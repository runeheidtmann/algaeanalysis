Recently, a parasite of an alga identified \nas Ceramium  rubrum  which had a \u201cthallus [\u2026] usually \ncomposed of a series of somewhat irregularly cylindrical, \nsausage-like segments\u201d was sequenced and used to epi -\ntypify the genus Pontisma  (as P . lagenidiodes ). Following \nan earlier speculation by Dick (2001), these authors then \ntransferred all holocarpic parasites of red algae into the \ngenus Pontisma  though this clade was unsupported in \ntheir phylogenetic analyses (Buaya et al.  2019, Buaya and \nThines 2020).\nSirolpidium H.E. Petersen was originally erected \nalongside Pontisma to account for the ability of its type, \nS. bryopsidis  to differentiate two types of thalli (olpidioid \nand fragmenting) within its green algal host Bryopsis plu -\nmosa (Petersen 1905, Sparrow 1960). The morphogenetic \nsimilarities between Pontisma and Sirolpidium had long \nbeen recognized and led to the suggestion of merging \nboth genera (Karling 1942). Recently, a pathogen of the \ngreen filamentous Ulotrichales, Capsosiphon fulvescens , \ntentatively likened to Sirolpidium bryopsidis , despite its \napparent inability to infect Bryopsis plumosa and differ -\nent geographic origin , was found to have a partial 18S \nsequence identical with Pontisma lagenidioides  (Buaya \net al. 2021). Finally, a novel pathogen of a second green \nfilamentous Ulotrichales, Urospora  neglecta , which  only \nshowed olpidioid thalli and had a 18S sequence that was \nsister, though with only moderate bootstrap support, to \nthe red algal parasite Olpidiopsis porphyrae . Having re -\nalized that Karling retained Sirolpidium  over Pontisma , \nthese authors now propose to assign all holocarpic, \npathogens of red and green algae mentioned above to the \ngenus Sirolpidium , within the monogeneric order Pontis -\nmatales (Buaya  et al. 2023 b). As defined in the latter pa -\nper, this group also encompasses pathogens of diatoms \nand brown algae (Garvetto et al.  2018, Buaya and Thines  \n2022), as well as environmental sequences from unchar -\nacterized organisms. \nThis body of work has led to repeated name changes to \nsome important red algal pathogens twice over the past \nfour years (Buaya et al.  2019, 2023 b), though it was obvi -\nous from all these papers that this new circumscription \nof Pontisma (or lately, Sirolpidium ) and the order Pontis -\nmatales was unsupported in any analyses (e.g., Badis  et \nal. 2019, Buaya et al. 2019, 2021, 2023 b, Buaya and Thines \n2020). We decided to reinvestigate the phylogeny of this \ngroup based on the same data set of publicly available \nsmall subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). Our results \nconfirm that the taxa Pontisma , Sirolpidium , and Pon -brown algae (Phaeophyceae), and diatoms (Bacillari -\nophyceae). They have been suggested to play potentially \nimportant roles in controlling phytoplankton dynamics \n(Garvetto et al. 2018) and represent a known or potential \nthreat for commercially cultivated algae (Badis et al. 2019, \n2020). The severe economic costs of these pathogens have \nincreased with the spread and intensification of seaweed \n(esp. red algal) aquaculture over the last decades (Kim et \nal. 2014, Wen et al. 2023). \nThese intracellular, obligately parasitic oomycetes in -\nfecting algae have started being described in the second \nhalf of the 19th century ( Fig. 1), with the delineation of \ntaxa based on a combination of morphological charac -\nters (e.g., flagellation of zoospores) and life cycle (e.g., \nmorphogenesis of sporangia). These early studies also \nsuggested that host specificity could have taxonomic util -\nity, yet this needed further study (Sparrow 1960). Later \nstudies on laboratory cultures indicated that parasites \nhad greater host diversity than originally assumed from\n\nDocument 1402: Algae 2024, 39(1): 43-50\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4490\/algae.2024.39.3.8\n482023 b). If it were confirmed as a monophyletic group, the \nconcept of this order would require being broadened to \naccommodate far greater diversity of hosts (including \nbrown algae and green algae), morphologies, and spore \nmorphogenesis than is currently the case. \nOver the last four years, two novel generic names, and \nthe accompanying nomenclatural changes, Pontisma and \nSirolpidium , have been proposed by Buaya et al. to desig -\nnate species of parasites of marine red algae: Olpidiopsis \nbostrychiae , O. feldmanni , O. heterosiphoniae , O. muel -\nleri, O. palmariae , O. porphyrae , and O. pyropiae . For \nthe reasons stated above, it is hard to see any improve -\nment over the original genus name Olpidiopsis , which \nat least has the merit of being widely used, especially by \napplied scientists and seaweed professionals from the \nindustry and government bodies. Even when justifiable \nfrom a taxonomic point of view, name changes for eco -\nlogically significant and economically important species \nhave deep consequences on society, potentially affecting \nlivelihoods or conservation policies. Consequently, we \nargue in favor of retaining the names of these taxa until \na robustly-supported nomenclatural revision can be per -\nformed.\nThough we are aware of the challenges hindering the \ndescription and classification of holocarpic oomycetes, \nwe feel that novel taxa should not be described without \nthe provision of several congruent markers: indeed, rely -\ning on partial 18S sequences is insufficient. While many of \nthese original descriptions are very insightful (e.g., Braun \n1855, Sparrow 1960), attaching names to newly collected \nspecimens, often on different hosts and different loca -\ntions, from the original descriptions that were based on \nfew characters (i.e., general similarity, sexual characters \nare missing in all red algal holocarpic pathogens) just \nbrings more confusion, and retards naming and describ -\ning new taxa. We recommend that the nomenclature of \nsupra-specific taxa should only be emended to produce \na natural classification, when the corresponding taxa are \nprecisely circumscribed with robust phylogenetic, mor -\nphological, and possibly ultrastructural or ecological cri -\nteria. Acquiring phylogenomic evidence on these taxa is \nmost likely to be key to enable such a step. \nCONCLUSION\nThe full diversity of biotropic oomycete pathogens \nis just now being explored. Our understanding of their \nrelationships is still hampered by a lack of datasets that \nresolve their relationships. Premature nomenclatural concerned are also questionable: on the one hand, Sirol -\npidium bryopsidis  had never been found before infecting \nCapsosiphon fulvescens . The latter host was collected in \nIceland, whereas the type was described from Frederik -\nshavn (Denmark), so that direct evidence is lacking that \nSirolpidium bryopsidis  is indeed the organism sequenced \nin Buaya et al. (2021). On the other hand, the host red alga \ndepicted as the host for the epitype of Pontisma lagen -\nidioides , is incompletely corticated (Buaya et al.  2019). \nTherefore, it is not C. rubrum  as stated by the authors, \nand is in fact an unidentified Ceramium sp. These two ex -\namples illustrate that defining epitypes is only useful, to \novercome the limitations of original taxonomic descrip -\ntions and to link them with molecular data, if utmost care \nis taken in the identification of host, choice of sampling \nlocation, and subsequent data analysis. \nThe novel parasite, Sirolpidium litorale , isolated from \nthe green alga Urospora neglecta  neither forms a clade \nwith the known SSU sequence for S. bryopsidis (Buaya et \nal. 2023 b, and our Fig. 1), nor seems to present typical fea -\ntures of this genus, such as fragmenting thalli (Petersen \n1905, Sparrow 1960). \nThe absence of monophyly between the clades of red \nalgal pathogens designated Pontisma  or Sirolpidium\n\nDocument 6302: Algae 2024, 39(1): 43-50\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4490\/algae.2024.39.3.8\nOpen  AccessNote\nCopyright  \u00a9 2024 The Korean Society of Phycology\n43\nhttp:\/\/e-algae.org   pISSN: 1226-2617   eISSN: 2093-0860Holocarpic oomycete parasites of red algae are not Olpidiopsis , \nbut neither are they all Pontisma  or Sirolpidium  (Oomycota) \nGiuseppe C.

Lately their diversity \nin marine environments has been shown to be greatly underappreciated and many lineages of intracellular holocarpic \nparasites, infecting micro- and macro-algae, remain to be fully described taxonomically. Among them, pathogens of ma -\nrine red algae have been studied extensively as they infect important seaweed crops. Throughout the 20th century, most \nintracellular, holocarpic biotrophic oomycetes that infect red algae have been assigned to the genus Olpidiopsis  Cornu. \nHowever, 18S rRNA sequencing of Olpidiopsis  saprolegniae , the species considered the generitype for Olpidiopsis , sug -\ngests that this genus is not closely related to the marine pathogens and that the latter requires a nomenclatural update. \nHere, we compile and reanalyze all recently published 18S rRNA sequence data for marine holocarpic oomycetes, with \na particular focus on holocarpic pathogens of red algae. Their taxonomy has been revised twice over the past four years, \nwith suggestions to transfer them first into the genus Pontisma  and then Sirolpidium , and into a monogeneric order, Pon -\ntismatales.

Every organ -\nism has a certain set of ion channels that define its physiology. Dinoflagellates are ecologically important microorgan -\nisms characterized by effective physiological adaptability, which backs up their massive proliferations that often result \nin harmful blooms (red tides). In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify homologs of known ion \nchannels that belong to 36 ion channel families. We demonstrated that the versatility of the dinoflagellate physiology is \nunderpinned by a high diversity of ion channels including homologs of animal and plant proteins, as well as channels \nunique to protists.

One type is the spon -\ntaneous non-propagated changes in the membrane po -\ntential that control movements of  a food-gathering ten -\ntacle\u2014and are known as a tentacle-regulating potential \n(Eckert and Sibaoka 1967, Sibaoka and Eckert 1967, Oami \net al. 1988). These changes in potential occur on the ten -\ntacle membrane in two phases: depolarization phase \ncaused by the opening of Ca2+-dependent Na+ channels, \nand hyperpolarizing phase caused by the opening of Cl- \nchannels (Eckert and Sibaoka 1967, Oami et al. 1988). Al -\nthough the molecular nature of these channels still has to \nbe unveiled, we assume that the sodium current could be \ntheoretically attributed to FVCC channels, since their ho -\nmologs  in dinoflagellates possess Ca2+-binding domains \nas it was revealed by the in silico  analysis (Pozdnyakov et \nal. 2018). In this work, we also identified several Cl- chan -\nnels including voltage-gated CLC channels that could \ntheoretically participate in the hyperpolarization phase \nof the tentacle-regulating potential. \nThe second type of exitability in N. miliaris  is a so-\ncalled flash-triggering potential, which controls biolu -\nminescence events. Notably, this all-or-none action po -\ntential develops not on the plasma membrane, but on \nthe inner vacuolar membrane system and is mediated \nby H+ current through the voltage-gated proton chan -\nnels (Eckert 1965, Eckert and Sibaoka 1968, Nawata and \nSibaoka, 1979, see section Proton transport and biolumi -\nnescence). \nCalcium signaling system\nCalcium ions modulate the activity of Ca2+-binding \nproteins found in all living organisms and represent \nthe only secondary messenger of ionic nature connect -\ning electrical and chemical signaling pathways in a cell. \nMany cellular processes depend on oscillations of the \nintracellular Ca2+ concentration, among them are endo- \nand exocytosis, movement, signal transduction, gene \nexpression, proliferation, apoptosis, etc. (Berridge et al. \n2003, Dominguez 2004). \nCalcium signaling system functioning depends on \nthe variety of ion channels localized in different cel -\nlular compartments, including the plasma membrane \nand membranes of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticu -\nlum, and intracellular vesicles (Berridge et al. 2003). The \nanalysis of dinoflagellate transcriptomes revealed several \nfamilies of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels activat -\ned by different stimuli: TRP , single-domain channels, and \nFVCC. Moreover, we found Ca2+-activated K+ channels BK are present in a moderate to large number of the inves -\ntigated dinoflagellate transcriptomes and, therefore, are \nlikely a part of the essential molecular machinery used by \nthese microorganisms.\nPreviously, we revealed the intrafamily phylogenetic \ndiversity of FVCC channels of dinoflagellates and other \neukaryotes (Pozdnyakov et al. 2018). Here we showed \nthat the dinoflagellate ion channels from one family (be -\nstrophins, BK, IP3R, K2P, and VDAC) did not form a single \nclade in all cases (Supplementary Fig. S1\u2013S5).

Under \nthe +2, +4, and +6\u00b0C conditions in winter, the distribution \nof S. gracilenta was  predicted not to differ from that dur -\ning 2015\u20132018 winter seasons ( Fig. 6B\u2013D).\nDISCUSSION\nUsing the culture of Shimiella gracilenta SGJH1904, the \npresent study revealed that the growth rates were zero \nor positive at 5\u201325\u00b0C but negative at 30\u201335\u00b0C, regardless \nof the presence of added prey. Our previous study in -\nvestigating the distribution of  S. gracilenta  at 28 stations \nin Korean coastal waters during the 2015 to 2018 period \nshowed that the lowest water temperature at which S. \ngracilenta cells were detected was 1.7\u00b0C (Ok et al. 2021 a). \nThus, S. gracilenta may survive at water temperatures \nconsiderably lower than 5\u00b0C, which is the lowest water \ntemperature tested in the present study. The highest wa -\nter temperature at which S. gracilenta cells were found in \nKorean coastal waters during 2015\u20132018 was 26.4\u00b0C (Ok \net al. 2021 a). Therefore, the results from the field data \nwere generally consistent with the experimental results of \nthe present study.\nAt 20 and 25\u00b0C, the growth rates of S. gracilenta  SGJH-\n1904 with prey were 0.73 and 0.85 d-1, respectively, where -\nas those without prey were 0.21 and 0.05 d-1. Further -\nmore, the ingestion rates of S. gracilenta  on prey at 20 and \n25\u00b0C were 0.04 and 0.05 ng C predator-1 d-1, respectively. \nThus, feeding elevated the growth rates of S. gracilenta  \nto a greater extent at 25\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C, and additional -\nly, changed the optimal temperature for supporting the \nmaximum growth rate.\nThe growth rates of T. amphioxeia , the prey species that \nsupports the highest growth rate of S. gracilenta , were \nnegative at \u226530\u00b0C (Kang et al. 2020). Therefore, water tem -\nperatures of \u226530\u00b0C may negatively affect the survival of S. \ngracilenta  directly (i.e., physical damage) and indirectly \n(prey limitation).\nThe results of the present study showed that the distri -\nbution of S. gracilenta may be affected by global warm -\ning in summer and autumn months in Korean waters. \nAccording to our prediction, in summer,  S. gracilenta is West Sea, four stations in the South Sea, two stations in \nthe East Sea, and three stations in Jeju Island ( Fig. 3A). \nUnder the +2, +4, and +6\u00b0C conditions in spring, the dis -\ntribution of S. gracilenta was  predicted not to differ from \nthat during 2015\u20132018 spring seasons ( Fig. 3B\u2013D).\nIn summer, the average water temperature during \n2015\u20132018 at the 28 stations in Korea was 19.1\u201325.7\u00b0C, \nand S. gracilenta did not exist at 10 stations: two stations \nin the West Sea, four stations in the South Sea, two sta -\ntions in the East Sea, and two stations in Jeju Island ( Fig. \n4A). However, under the +2\u00b0C condition, S. gracilenta was \npredicted not to survive at 14 stations: five stations in the \nWest Sea, five stations in the South Sea, two stations in \nthe East Sea, and two stations in Jeju Island ( Fig. 4B).

The bioactive properties of fucoidan preparations have been assessed in a range of in vitro\nand animal models [ 5] and include demonstrated antimicrobial [ 6], antiviral [ 7] and anticancer [ 8]\ne\ufb00ects. While evidence from animal models suggests fucoidans may also possess immune-modulating\ne\ufb00ects [ 9,10], the ability of fucoidans to act as potential modulators of mucosal health generally,\nand mucosal immune function appears underappreciated and requires further investigation given\n(i) the fucose-based structure of fucoidans, (ii) the role of fucose as a terminal sugar in human mucin\nglycoproteins [ 11], and (iii) evidence from ex vivo tissue preparations suggesting fucose may regulate\ngut motility [12].\nWe utilized a cohort of professional team-sport athletes to explore the potential impacts of fucoidan\non gut markers of immunity and in\ufb02ammation. The potential for intense physical activity to induce\nalterations in immune function, including markers of mucosal immunity, and increase risk for upper\nrespiratory symptoms has been of interest for several decades [ 13,14]. Assessment of mucosal immune\ncompetence in athletes has typically utilized saliva samples and included assessment of both innate\n(e.g., lactoferrin and lysozyme) and adaptive (e.g., secretory immunoglobulin A; sIgA) markers and\nis considered relevant to protective mechanisms in the upper respiratory tract. Indeed, associations\nbetween low mucosal (tear) lysozyme concentrations [ 15] and salivary IgA [ 16,17] and risk for upper\nrespiratory tract infection are reported in the literature. Interestingly, assessment of immune markers\nfrom other mucosal sites has been less common, which is somewhat surprising given the growing\ninterest in gut health in athletic populations. In this regard, high-performance and elite athletes\nrepresent a unique population for assessment of potential positive e \ufb00ects of fucoidan supplementation\non markers of mucosal immune function.\n2. Results\nThe supplement was well-tolerated by participants with no adverse events reported.

A later study observed increased treadmill distance and an upregulation \nof genes to stimulate angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in mice given UPF, \nfucoxanthin, hesperetin, and caffeic acid for 8 weeks compared to control [25]. Recently, \nMcBean et al. observed a significant association between muscle fiber hypertrophy and \nmuscle force production in mice supplemented with 400 mg\/kg day of a blended fucoi -\ndan from UPF and Fucus vesiculosus along with neutral carbohydrates via oral gavage for \n4 weeks compared to control mice that received water via oral gavage, suggesting that \nfucoidan supplementation may improve these outcomes during exercise [26]. Research \nperformed on UPF combined with exercise in humans is scarce. However, one pilot study \nindicated increased fecal lysosomes, which are antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory in \naction, in high-performance athletes following a 1-week daily dosage of fucoidan from F. \nvesiculosus and UPF during pre-season training camp [27]. Generally, pre-season training \nincreases exercise intensity and volume to prepare for competition. Athletes had 73% \nlower levels of fecal lysosomes at baseline compared to the healthy adult comparator \ngroup, but within participant analysis following fucoidan supplementation showed ath-\nlete lysosomes count improved 43% compared to their baseline levels [27].\nFucoidans may be able to improve inflammation and immune responses following \nexercise. If efficacious, acute supplementation with fucoidan may lessen physiological \ndisruption following HIE, which may benefit individuals who regularly engage in activities \ninvolving repeated efforts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the \nsafety and efficacy of UPF on markers of inflammation and immune response following an \nacute bout of HIE. The primary hypothesis was that UPF supplementation would reduce \nthe inflammatory cytokine and immune cell response following interval-based HIE com -\npared to placebo. Since fucoidan may attenuate levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that \nhave been linked to increased fatigue during exercise [2,14,28], a secondary hypothesis \nwas that UPF supplementation may allow participants to maintain higher power output \nand performance during the interval-based HIE by reducing muscle fatigue.\n2.Materials and methods\n2.1.

This makes the reactor system easier to design and can be built with less capital costs. A multi-stage operation, on the other hand, carries out the different conversion stages in multiple reactor vessels. Generally, the first two stages, hydrolysis and acidogenesis are carried out in one reactor while acetogenesis and methanogenesis are carried out in a separate reactor. Multi-stage operation is suggested to perform better than single-stage operations because it results in a proper fermentation of the loaded wastes with limited generation of inhibitors or by-products.

Generally, the\n\ufb01rst two stages, i.e., hydrolysis and acidogenesis are carried out in one reactor while\nacetogenesis and methanogenesis are carried out in a separate reactor (Fig. 6.5)\n[117]. Thus, all the stages can be operated at their optimal process conditions (pH,\ntemperature, OLR, etc.).\nIt has been suggested that multistage operation perform better than single-stage\noperations because the former results in a proper fermentation of the loaded wastes\nwith limited generation of inhibitors or by-products [ 2]. For example, the solid-state\nAD of brewery spent grain (BSG) in a single-stage reactor was limited by the\ninhibitors, such as weak acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic substances, generated\nin the degradation of lignocellulose in BSG [ 118]. However, it is noteworthy to\nmention that although multistage AD system has the advantage of improved AD\nperformance, the need for high capital investments and operating costs hampers its\nimplementation at a commercial scale. As a result, single-stage AD is still\npredominantly used.\nFig. 6.4 Schematic representation of a single-stage AD operating system. In a single-stage AD all\nthe four stages of decomposition occurs in a single reactor to convert solid wastes into biogas6 Recycling of Multiple Organic Solid Wastes into Biogas via Anaerobic Digestion 195\n\nDocument 5880: methanogens. A maximum OLR level in solid-state AD depends on various param-\neters such as reactor design, feedstock characteristics, microbial activity, tempera-\nture, pH, and toxicity level [ 115].

Hence, estimating the PP in the\u00a0territorial sea\u00a0of each country is a necessary step to achieving carbon neutrality. \nTo estimate the PP in the\u00a0territorial sea\u00a0of the Republic of\u00a0Korea\u00a0from 2005 to 2021, we\u00a0analyzed various physiochemical \nparameters, such as sea surface temperature (SST), Secchi depth, and concentrations of chlorophyll- a and nutrients in \nthe seas of five regions, including the East Sea, West Sea, western South Sea, eastern South Sea, and the waters off Jeju \nIsland. During the 17-year study period, the SST tended to increase, while the nutrient concentrations declined, except in \nthe Jeju area. Overall, the PP did not show a specific temporal trend, but daily PP in the western South Sea was the highest \namong the five regions. Moreover, the maximum PP in the Korean territorial waters (76,450 km2) was estimated at 11,227 \nGg C y-1, which accounts for 0.03 % of the global PP . The results may give insights into a better understanding of the PP , \nfurther resource utilization, and environmental sustainability in the studied region.\nKeywords:  carbon cycle; light utilization; photosynthetic assimilation; phytoplankton; primary productivity \nINTRODUCTION\nOceans are one of the largest storages of carbon diox -\nide (CO2) on the planet and play a major role in the global \ncarbon cycle by absorbing approximately 30 % of atmo -\nspheric CO2 each year (Raven and Falkowski 1999). Al -\nthough both pelagic and benthic communities of primary \nproducers are responsible for primary production (PP) in \nthe ocean, approximately half of the global annual net PP \nis produced by marine phytoplankton (Field et al. 1998, \nSpector and Edward 2020, Luo et al. 2021). This prima -\nry source of energy supports the entire marine biomass \nthrough food webs (Turner 2004, Eom et al. 2021, Jeong et \nal. 2021, Lee et al. 2021, Ok et al. 2021). Thus, it is crucial \nto accurately assess the geographical and temporal vari -ability in phytoplankton production to better understand \nthe global carbon dynamics and trophic energy flow.\nCoastal waters support a high PP of approximately \n10\u201330 % of the global ocean production (Muller-Karger et \nal. 2005, Salgado-Hernanz et al. 2022). Moreover, physical \nand biological processes in coastal waters play an impor -\ntant role in carbon transport to deep oceans (Cai 2011). \nTherefore, estimating and comprehending PP in coastal \nwaters is crucial for improving our understanding of the \nmarine carbon cycle. \nHowever, PP by marine phytoplankton is influenced by \nvarious physiochemical factors that are directly related to \nphytoplankton physiology, such as light, turbidity, water \nReceived  October 10, 2022,  Accepted  November 28, 2022\n*Corresponding Author\nE-mail: hjjeong@snu.ac.kr\nTel: +82-2-880-6746,   Fax: +82-2-874-9695This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms \nof the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial \nLicense (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/3.0\/) which permits \nunrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nDocument 3580: late with a novel type of body scale.

Meanwhile, the immunosuppressive Tregs (CD4\u00feFoxp3\u00fecells) was decreased.","reference_context":"Document 5402: cells were quantitative detected by Flow Cytometer (Beckman\nCoulter, Inc.). As shown in Fig. 9 A and B, mature DCs (CD11c\u00fe\nCD86\u00fecells and CD11c\u00feCD80\u00fecells) was signi\ufb01cantly\nincreased in spleens treated with FD\/DOX. As in the 4T1 tumor, it\nwas obvious that FD\/DOX treatment enhanced the recruitment of\nCD8\u00feT cells (CD8\u00feIFN-g\u00fecells in Fig. 9 C) and CD4\u00feT cells\n(CD4\u00fecells in Fig. 9 D). Meanwhile, the immunosuppressive\nTregs (CD4\u00feFoxp3\u00fecells in Fig. 9 E) was decreased. These re-\nsults demonstrate that FD\/DOX exhibited strong immune stimu-\nlating effect, through which better anti-tumor ef\ufb01cacy could beachieved.\nIn addition, it was proved in many studies that the immuno-\nsuppressive G-MDSCs (CD11b\n\u00feLy6G\u00fecells) can be recruited to\ndistant organs and assist the formation of premetastatic niche\n(PMN), thus promoting the colonization and proliferation of\ntumor cells45,46. As shown in Fig. 9 F and G, the G-MDSCs in the\nlungs and livers of tumor-bearing mice were signi\ufb01cantly morethan that of tumor free mice. PSGL-1 expressed on G-MDSCs was\ncrucial for their recruitment by binding P-selectin on vascular\nendothelium\n47. Therefore, the micelle FD\/DOX might inhibit G-\nMDSCs recruitment in premetastatic organs by competitively\nbinding P-selectin. The results in Fig. 9 F and G con\ufb01rm that FD\/\nDOX treatment signi\ufb01cantly reduced the percentage of G-MDSCsin the lungs and livers to a level similar to that in tumor free mice.\nThe inhibition of G-MDSCs recruitment would further enhance\nCD8\n\u00feT cell-mediated immune response, since cytokines secreted\nby G-MDSCs, such as IL-10, could inhibit the activity of CD8\u00feT\ncells48. As a result, FD\/DOX treatment reversed the immuno-\nsuppressive microenvironment in distant organs, prevented theimplantation and survival of tumor cells, and \ufb01nally achievedbetter anti-metastasis ef\ufb01cacy.4. Conclusions\nIn this study, a fucoidan-functionalized micelle FD\/DOX was\nconstructed successfully, which could adhere to activated platelets\nthrough P-selectin. The micelle FD\/DOX could effectively target\nprimary tumor, CTCs, and metastatic site in distant organs byhitchhiking on activated platelets recruited by tumor cells. P-selectin expressed on vascular endothelium also assisted the\naccumulation of FD\/DOX. Accurately tracking and killing tumor\ncells resulted in excellent anti-tumor and anti-metastasis ef\ufb01cacyof FD\/DOX. In addition, FD\/DOX treatment was con\ufb01rmed to\ninhibit the expression of TGF- b, which solved a trouble caused by\nplatelet recruitment, and effectively stimulated anti-tumor immuneresponse, contributing to the anti-cancer treatment. In summary,\nthe fucoidan-functionalized activated platelets-targeting micelle\nprovided a promising strategy for metastatic cancer treatment byaccurately tracking of tumor cells and remodeling the microen-vironment in primary tumor and premetastatic organs.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (81974499 and 81690261), and Sichuan Science andTechnology Program (2018RZ0136).\nAuthor contributions\nRong Guo and Qin He designed the research.

Enhanced targeting ability of FD\/DOX to primary tumor\nand metastasis\nThe accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor is critical for its anti-\ntumor ef\ufb01cacy. However, the removal of nanoparticles by the\nreticuloendothelial system (RES) usually leads to a lack of anti-tumor ef\ufb01cacy, since only a small portion of nanoparticles can\nreach the tumor site\n43. In this study, the biodistribution of micelles\nwas investigated at different stages of cancer.\nOn Day 10 after 4T1 cells inoculation, the early stage of cancer\ndevelopment, mice were intravenously injected with DOX, DD\/DOX or FD\/DOX (DOX-equivalent 2.5 mg\/kg), respectively, and\nsacri\ufb01ced at 1, 8 and 24 h. The time-dependent biodistribution ofDOX, DD\/DOX and FD\/DOX measured by IVIS (PerkinElmer,Inc.) was shown in Fig. 4 A. The semiquantitative analysis of mean\n\ufb02uorescence intensity of tumors and major organs was shown in\nFig. 4 B and Supporting Information Fig. S14 . Free DOX was\ndistributed mainly in the liver and kidney and cleared quickly.\nCompared with free DOX, DD\/DOX showed stronger \ufb02uorescence\nsignal in tumor because of the passive targeting effect. However,the \ufb02uorescence of DD\/DOX in liver and kidney remained at a high\nlevel. As for FD\/DOX, the \ufb02uorescence signal in tumor was strong\nat each time point, even stronger than that of DD\/DOX, suggestingthat FD\/DOX could effectively accumulate in tumor for a long\ntime.

Fucoidan is made up  of L-fucose, sulfate groups and \none or more small proportions of xylose,  mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, \nglucuronic acid and acetyl groups in a variety of brown algae [13 \u201315]. In a number of studies, \nresearchers have also used galactofucan to represent a kind of fucoidan. Galactofucan is known as a \nmonosaccha ride, and the composition of the monosaccharide is galactose accompanied by fucose , \nsimilar to rhamnofucan (rhamnose and fucose)  and rhamnogalactofucan (rhamnose, galactose and \nfucose). In addition to the structure of fucoidan, there is also a variation am ongst different seaweed \ntypes. Nevertheless, fucoidan normally has two types of homofucose ( Figure 2 ). One type (I) \nencompasses repeated (1 \u21923)-L-fucopyranose, and the other type (II) encompasses alternating and \nrepeated (1 \u21923)- and (1\u21924)-L-fucopyranose [ 16]. \nReports based on structures of fucoidan, sourced from different species of brown algae, brought \nabout an improved categorization in terms of structures. By a way of illustration, most of the \nfucoidans sourced from species belonging to the Fucales  have  an alternating linkage of \n(1\u21923)-\u03b1-L-fucose and (1\u21924)-\u03b1-L-fucose [ 17\u201321]. Structures of Ascophyllum nodosum  fucoidan [ 22] and \nF. vesiculosus fucoidan show a resemblance of one another, the difference is only significant based on \nsulfate  patterns and the presence of glucuronic acid. A number of Fucales  species, such as Fucus \nserratus , Fucus distichus  and Pelvetia canaliculate , present  similar  fucoidan backbone, but show more \ndiversity in the branching and the presence of different monosac charides [ 20,21,23]. However, \nexceptions do exist, for instance, fucoidans from the Bifurcaria bifucardia  and Himanthalia elongate  do \nnot follow or ascribe to such a structur al feature  [24]. Hence, identifying the structure of fucoidan \nbased on the species  they belong to presents a challenge.  \nFigure 1. Sources of fucoidan. 1.

One type (I) encompasses repeated\n(1\u21923)-l-fucopyranose, and the other type (II) encompasses alternating and repeated (1 \u21923)- and\n(1\u21924)-l-fucopyranose [16].\n\nDocument 1313: Foods 2023 ,12, 878 13 of 17\nSeveral reports have concentrated on the production of FOSs, and the enzymatic degra-\ndation of fucoidan into FOSs is a promising method; however, it has only been investigated\nin the laboratory. Further research should focus on the design and development of novel\npreparation methods that are suitable for FOSs in industrial scale-up processes. In addition,\nbecause FOSs can vary in their glycosidic linkages, MW, and sulphate content, pharmaceu-\ntical activities may also vary. Therefore, research on the structure\u2013function relationship of\nFOSs will become a main focus for the application of FOSs in various areas. This review\nand the data summarized and discussed here can encourage innovative research on FOSs,\nand future research should focus on the preparation, biological activities, and regulatory\nmechanisms of FOSs, thus providing more fundamental data for their future application.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.Z. and K.-L.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nM.W.; funding acquisition, S.Z. and K.-L.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.W., S.V ., S.Z. and K.-L.C.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported in part by the Key-Area Research and Development Program\nof Guangdong Province (2020B1111030004), The Innovative Team Program of High Education of\nGuangdong Province (2021KCXTD021), and The Program for Scienti\ufb01c Research Start-up Funds of\nGuangdong Ocean University (2023).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: No new data were created or analyzed in this study.

Intraperitoneal injection and\/or administration of fucoidan \nthrough food, gavages, subcutaneous injection, and intravenous injection have also been \nthoroughly researched [25\u201329]. \n2. Anticancer Potential of Fucoidan: Insights from Recent Studies \nCancer is a composite disease with unpreced ented cell growth. Factors such as sepsis, \nsmoking, occupational exposure, environmenta l pollution, obstructive diet, and heredi-\ntary components influence the complex procedure of the growth and development of the \nhuman body [30]. Tumor cell propagation and maintenance are generally associated with \nuncommon subcellular signal transduction and the uninterrupted sustenance of cellular \ngrowth [31]. For example, because of its participation in numerous cellular functions in-\nvolving mRNA, cell cycle regulation, gene copy, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism, \nthe P13K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is of ten engaged. Surgery, radiotherapy, and \nchemotherapy are the main dependable lines of cancer treatment [32\u201334]. However, the \nside effects of these treatments are signific ant, and the therapeutic outcomes are limited. \nIt has been observed that a few of the inhere nt intrinsic signaling pathways can hinder or \nslow carcinogenesis at different phases and th ey exhibit characteristics such as explicit \ntargeting, reduced cytotoxicity, and the indu ction of cancer cell apoptosis [35\u201338]. \nFigure 1.

Drugs 2021 ,19, 30 2 of 20\nFurthermore, fucoidan has been implicated as a plausible antidiabetic agent as some\nfucoidans have inhibited the primary starch digesting enzymes; amylase and glucosidase,\ndirectly linked to postprandial hyperglycaemia [ 5,10]. Nevertheless, limited studies have\ninvestigated the potential therapeutic effects of fucoidan on the several possible control\npoints of glucose metabolism. Notably, diabetes and cancer progression are linked with\nshared factors which involve glucose metabolism pathophysiology [ 11]. Therefore, this\nreview provides an overview of glucose metabolism, highlighting the possible therapeutic\ntargets for fucoidan, as it has demonstrated dual biological activity against cancer and\ndiabetes.\n2. Fucoidan Structure\n2.1. Fucoidan Backbone & Monosaccharide Composition\nFucoidans vary in their structure and composition but are primarily composed of a\npentose sugar backbone comprised of fucose residues that are linked by \u03b1-(1\u20133), \u03b1-(1\u20133)- \u03b1-\n(1\u20134) or \u03b1-(1\u20133)- \u03b1-(1\u20132) linkages [ 1]. Fucoidans are heterogeneous in their monosaccharide\ncomposition with different monosaccharides occurring in different fucoidans extracted\nfrom various species and their proportions varying depending on the extraction process\nemployed. The numerous neutral monosaccharides reported constituting fucoidans include\nglucose, galactose, xylose, mannose and rhamnose [ 6,12]. Furthermore, fucoidan may\ncontain acetate and uronic acids, including glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid [ 13,14].\nThe monosaccharide units may substitute molecular entities on the fucoidan structure or\nmay represent contamination of the fucoidan extracts with other polysaccharides [12].\n2.2. Sulphate Content and Position\nThe sulphate content and overall degree of sulphation in fucoidans vary signi\ufb01cantly\nbetween species. Variations in fucoidan sulphate content as a function of harvests over\ndifferent seasons have also been reported numerous times in literature. For instance,\nvarying sulphate content was reported among three species, namely, F. serratus ,F. vesiculosus\nand A. nodosum, and within species harvested in different seasons [ 15]. The study further\nnoted that the fucose and sulphate contents varied proportionally to each other and were\ninversely proportional to the total fucoidan content. A study on the galactofucans from\nSaccharina longicruris reported a 1.6% increase in sulphate content between March and\nNovember 2005, while the sulphate content decreased by 7.2% between November 2005 and\nJune 2006 [ 15]. The sulphate group positioning is also one of the main qualities of fucoidan\nthat determines its structural and functional capabilities [ 16]. It has been established that\nsingle and double sulphate group substitutions occur at the C-2 or C-4 positions of furanose\nresidues constituting two types of fucoidan chain structures (the (1 \u21923)-\u03b1-L-fucopyranose\nresidues and \u03b1-L-fucopyranose residues linked by (1 \u21923) and (1\u21924) glycosidic bonds [ 16].\nMoreover, sulphate substitutions in fucoidans also occur on the C-2 and C-3 positions of\nother monosaccharide residues [ 17]. The methodologies employed in the determination\nof sulphate content within fucoidans include infrared spectroscopy (IR), de-sulphation,\nthe stability of sulphate esters to alkali and methylation analysis [ 7]. Nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy can also be used to analyse the presence and\npositioning of sulphate residues on fucoidan [7].\n2.3. Molecular Weight\nThe molecular weight of fucoidans has been one of the many factors affecting their\nfunctional properties. Fucoidan size varies from 10 kDa to about 10,000 kDa depending\non the fucoidan source with the average size being approximately 20 kDa. [ 17]. The\nconsiderable variation in the size of fucoidans has led to the categorisation of fucoidans;\nlow molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF) when <10 kDa in size, medium molecular weight\n\nDocument 256: Mar.

Structure of Fucoidan  \nFucoidan is known as a fucose -enriched and sulfated polysaccharide that is mainly sourced \nfrom the extracellular matrix of brown algae. Fucoidan is made up  of L-fucose, sulfate groups and \none or more small proportions of xylose,  mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, \nglucuronic acid and acetyl groups in a variety of brown algae [13 \u201315]. In a number of studies, \nresearchers have also used galactofucan to represent a kind of fucoidan. Galactofucan is known as a \nmonosaccha ride, and the composition of the monosaccharide is galactose accompanied by fucose , \nsimilar to rhamnofucan (rhamnose and fucose)  and rhamnogalactofucan (rhamnose, galactose and \nfucose). In addition to the structure of fucoidan, there is also a variation am ongst different seaweed \ntypes. Nevertheless, fucoidan normally has two types of homofucose ( Figure 2 ). One type (I) \nencompasses repeated (1 \u21923)-L-fucopyranose, and the other type (II) encompasses alternating and \nrepeated (1 \u21923)- and (1\u21924)-L-fucopyranose [ 16]. \nReports based on structures of fucoidan, sourced from different species of brown algae, brought \nabout an improved categorization in terms of structures. By a way of illustration, most of the \nfucoidans sourced from species belonging to the Fucales  have  an alternating linkage of \n(1\u21923)-\u03b1-L-fucose and (1\u21924)-\u03b1-L-fucose [ 17\u201321]. Structures of Ascophyllum nodosum  fucoidan [ 22] and \nF. vesiculosus fucoidan show a resemblance of one another, the difference is only significant based on \nsulfate  patterns and the presence of glucuronic acid. A number of Fucales  species, such as Fucus \nserratus , Fucus distichus  and Pelvetia canaliculate , present  similar  fucoidan backbone, but show more \ndiversity in the branching and the presence of different monosac charides [ 20,21,23]. However, \nexceptions do exist, for instance, fucoidans from the Bifurcaria bifucardia  and Himanthalia elongate  do \nnot follow or ascribe to such a structur al feature  [24]. Hence, identifying the structure of fucoidan \nbased on the species  they belong to presents a challenge.  \nFigure 1. Sources of fucoidan. 1.

The anti-inflammatory effect of SF6 is attributed to the modulation of NF- \u03baB, MAPKs, and JAK2-STAT1 \/3 signaling pathways.","reference_context":"Document 2889: including nitric oxide (NO), NO synthase\n(iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor\nnecrosis factor- \u03b1(TNF- \u03b1), interleukin- \u03b2\n(IL-\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). A\nmechanism study showed that SF6 could\neffectively inhibit in\ufb02ammatory responses\nthrough blocking LPS-induced in\ufb02ammation\npathways, including nuclear factor- \u03baB\n(NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK), and Janus kinase (JAK)-2 and signal\ntransducer and activator of transcription\n(STAT)-1\/3 pathways.Ye et al. (2020) [70]\n\nDocument 1108: Mar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 328 14 of 17\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the present study provided evidence that SF6 exerted an anti-in\ufb02ammatory\ne\ufb00ect through suppression of production of pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines such as TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2,\nand IL-6 and other mediators, including iNOS and COX-2. The molecular mechanism research\nindicated that the anti-in\ufb02ammatory e \ufb00ect of SF6 was attributed to the modulation of NF- \u03baB, MAPKs,\nand JAK2-STAT1 \/3 signaling pathways. Additionally, SF6 has the potential to be developed as broad\nspectrum anti-in\ufb02ammation drugs or health products. Further studies regarding the structure and\nbioactivities of fucoidans are in progress to determine correlation between the molecular structures\nand biological activities.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.Y. and M.X.; methodology, D.C.; software, J.Y. and D.C.; validation,\nZ.Y., Y.H., N.Z., E.M.K.L., C.X., and M.X.; resources, J.Y. and M.X.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.J.;\nwriting\u2014review and editing, J.Y., E.M.K.L., and M.X.; project administration, J.Y. and M.X.; funding acquisition,\nJ.Y.

Likewise, Wei Zhang et al.,\n2021 reported that Macrocystis pyrifera, strongly upregulated the expression of CD 80, CD\n83, CD 86, MHC class I and MHC class II, induced the expression of pro-in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokines expression (TNF- \u03b1, and IL-6) and promoted the human monocyte-derived\ndendritic cells (MODC) and human peripheral blood DC (PBDC) activation [ 63]. In contrast\nto their \ufb01ndings, here we provide evidence for the \ufb01rst time on fucoidan extracted from\nMacrocystis pyrifera , which we found to have strong anti-in\ufb02ammatory effects in our LPS\ninduced in vitro model. All three extracts of Macrocystis pyrifera, were effective against LPS\ninduced pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines. The lowest molecular weight extract of Macrocystis\npyrifera, was the most potent inhibitor at lower concentrations of both TNF- \u03b1and IL-\n1\u03b2in LPS stimulated human THP-1 cells. This suppressive action suggests a potential\ntherapeutic role.\nIn the current investigation, for the \ufb01rst time, four novel depyrogenated extracts have\nbeen studied from Undaria pinnati\ufb01da and Fucus vesiculosus (Figures 3B,C,E,F and 4B,C,E,F).\nEven though fucoidans have the potential for use in diverse and clinically important ap-\nplications. A considerable challenge in exploiting the bene\ufb01ts of these molecules is the\npresence of pyrogenic agents (endotoxins) in the extracts. primarily, where the disease\nindication requires parenteral administration. The direct application of these extracts to a\nwound or a surgical site, or implantation within the body, is contraindicated due to the\nlinked dangers of pyrogen-induced fever, toxic shock, and even death. The process of\nremoval of these pyrogens is called depyrogenation. Although in our results the depyro-\ngenated extracts have shown reduced suppression of in\ufb02ammatory cytokine, an interesting\nreverse dose dependent trend in the suppression of TNF- \u03b1production is observed. This re-\nduced suppression at higher concentration and greater suppression at lower concentration\ncould be associated to extra pure fucoidan extracts obtained after depyrogenation method,\nas a result these fucoidan extracts interact with cell surface receptors more effectively at\nlower concentrations. We understand that the use of depyrogenated fucoidan extracts\nfor their anti-in\ufb02ammatory has been reported for the \ufb01rst time and such reverse dose\ndependent effect can further be elaborated using future experiments with much lower\nconcentration, thus generating a better dose dependent response for these extracts. From\nthis study, we can conclude that depyrogenated fractions have better anti-in\ufb02ammatory\nproperties than the original fractions, although these outcomes must be checked in the\npre-clinical disease models.\nSimilarly, LMWF depyrogenated extracts show the similar trend, but with most\nof the LMWF extracts showing even increased suppression at lower concentrations. It\ncould be related to the lower molecular weight of these extracts that is directly related to\nbetter absorption of these extracts through the cell surface. Similarly, previously stated\nthat LMWF are ef\ufb01cient molecules due to their better absorption and rapid mode of\naction. However, there long-term effects in the cell environment have been debatable\nin some recent investigations. Nevertheless, LMWF have been off immense interest in\nthe development of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries due to their promising\nproperties. Further experiments with a focus on generating a dose response curve should\nbe performed and anti-in\ufb02ammatory effect of these low molecule should be studied at\nfurther lower concentrations.\nHere, our work indicates that fucoidan extracts reduced the levels of pro-in\ufb02ammatory\n\nDocument 4297: Mar.

We analyzed fucoidans obtained from \nAscophyllum nodosum  (A. nodosum ), Macrocystis pyrifera  (M. pyrifera ), Undaria pinnatifida  \n(U. pinnatifida ) and Fucus vesiculosus  (F. vesiculosus ) for their effect on the apoptosis of \nhuman neutrophils, activation of mouse NK cells , maturation of spleen DCs, proliferation \nand activation of T cells, and the adjuvant effect  in vivo . Fucoidans from M. pyrifera   \nand U. pinnatifida  strongly delayed human neutrophil apoptosis at low concentration, \nwhereas fucoidans from A. nodosum  and F. vesiculosus  delayed human neutrophil \napoptosis at higher concentra tion. Moreover, fucoidan from M. pyrifera  promoted NK cell \nactivation and cytotoxi c activity against YAC-1 cells. In addition, M. pyrifera  fucoidan \ninduced the strongest activation of spleen DC s and T cells and ovalbumin (OVA) specific \nimmune responses compared to other fucoidans.  These data suggest that fucoidan from  OPEN ACCESS\n\nDocument 5101: Mar.

Several previous reports have demon-\nstrated the anti-in\ufb02ammatory activities of fucoidan and fucoidan-containing extracts in\ndifferent experimental models in vitro and in vivo [2,3,21,22]. One of the previous in vivo\nstudies from our research group revealed that dietary fucoidan extracts from Undaria pin-\nnati\ufb01da and Fucus vesiculosus were highly effective in ameliorating dextran sulfate sodium\n(DSS)-induced colitis in mice through a consistent downregulation of a signi\ufb01cant number\nof pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines, including TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-6 [ 14]. It is now generally\nrecognized that the in\ufb02ammatory response in patients and animal models of in\ufb02ammatory\nbowel disease (IBD) is primarily macrophage driven [ 14,21\u201323]. In the event of intestinal\nin\ufb02ammation, monocytes are recruited and differentiated into macrophages within the\nlamina propria [ 14,22]. It is considered that the initial exposure of interstitial macrophages\nto bacterial antigens is responsible for the activation of macrophages and that, at least in\nthe DSS model, these activated macrophages subsequently stimulate the proliferation of\nT cells [ 14]. Macrophages play a crucial role in stimulating and modulating the immune\nresponse (14). Furthermore, they regulate the function of adaptive immunity through\ncell-to-cell interaction or \ufb02uid-phase modulation via chemokines and cytokines [ 24]. The\nbiological activities of macrophages, including phagocytosis, migration, and cytokine\nsecretion, are critical to the immune response outcome [25].\nFollowing on from our previous in vivo \ufb01ndings on a colitis model using fucoidan\nfrom Undaria pinnati\ufb01da and a fucoidan-polyphenol extract from Fucus vesiculosus [14], this\npresent study investigates the effect of multiple fucoidan extracts on lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) induced whole human PBMC and THP-1 monocyte cell lines on pro-in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokine production. Fucoidan from \ufb01ve different sources has been used in the current in-\nvestigation, including Undaria pinnati\ufb01da (UPF), Fucus vesiculosus (FVF), Macrocystis pyrifera\n(MPF), Ascophyllum nodosum (ANF), and Laminaria japonica (LJF). Extracts from UPF, FVF,\nand MPF were further depyrogenated and\/or fractionated to yield depyrogenated (DP)\nand low molecular weight fucoidan extracts (LMWF). The source, purity, and molecular\nweight for each extract are described in Table 1. Here, we aimed to compare the anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory effects of these extracts with a primary focus on major pro-in\ufb02ammatory\nmarkers, including TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-6 and assess the dose-dependent inhibition of\nthese cytokines after pre-treatment with fucoidan extracts. Additionally, we also sought to\ninvestigate the cytotoxic effects of these fucoidan extracts in our experimental model.\nTable 1.

The injection of mice with fucoidans from brown algae\nAscophyllum nodosum ,Macrocystis pyrifera ,Undaria pinnati\ufb01da, and F. vesiculosus led to strengthening\nof the production of IgG1 and IgG2a OVA- speci\ufb01c immunoglobulins and also the T-cell response and\ngeneration of T-memory cells [ 9]. Fucoidans from algae Grateloupia \ufb01licina ,Ulva pertusa, and Sargassum\nqingdaoense di\ufb00ering in chemical structure showed antiviral activity towards avian in\ufb02uenza virus\nH9N2 subtype and immunomodulatory activity both in vitro and in vivo [10], and fucoidan from\nSargassum pallidum strengthened speci\ufb01c humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccine antigens\nof the combined vaccine against Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, and avian in\ufb02uenza in\nexperiments on chickens [ 11]. The adjuvant activity of fucoidan from F. vesiculosus towards a vaccine\nstrain of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was revealed [ 12]. This polysaccharide promoted strengthening of\nthe production of speci\ufb01c antibodies to the studied antigen and also an expression of the molecules\nMHC II, CD25, and CD69 on spleen cells and CD19 on B-lymphocytes. Treatment of mice BALB \/c\nspleen cells with fucoidan together with a vaccine of the Bordetella bronchiseptica antigen led to increased\nTNF- \u03b1production at lower doses of the antigen, which can be the mechanism providing the stimulating\nin\ufb02uence on the functional activity of e \ufb00ector cells of innate and adaptive immunity, strengthening the\nvaccination e \ufb03ciency [ 12]. Based on the results, the authors conclude that fucoidans can function as\nadjuvants in various type of preventive and therapeutic vaccines.\nThe de\ufb01ning property of vaccines adjuvants is their ability to stimulate (modulate) the innate and\nadaptive immunity system.\nResearch on the immunostimulatory (immunomodulatory) properties of fucoidans in various\nexperimental models showed that the main target for fucoidans are e \ufb00ector cells of innate immunity:\nmonocytes \/macrophages [ 13,14], neutrophilis [ 15], and NK-cells [ 9,16\u201318]. Due to the ability of\nfucoidans to stimulate cytotoxic e \ufb00ects of NK, the potential e \ufb00ect of fucoidans as adjuvants in the\nanticancer immune response is under intensive study [ 18]. It has been reported that fucoidans promote\nDC maturation [8,16,19,20].\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of adjuvant action provides important information on how innate\nimmunity in\ufb02uences the development of adaptive immunity, helping in the rational selection of vaccine\nadjuvants. In this regard, the processes of activation and di \ufb00erentiation of cells of innate and adaptive\nimmunity require special attention when studying the adjuvant activity of fucoidans.\nThe objects of our study were fucoidans (native, highly puri\ufb01ed products of fucoidan enzymatic\nhydrolysis) from brown alga F. evanescens, belonging to the family Fucaceae, genus Fucus. As a result of\nthe research, the activating e \ufb00ects (F1-3) on the innate and adaptive immunity cells were detected,\nas evidenced by the increased expression of activation markers. In particular, fucoidans induce the\nmaturation of DCs, enhance the ability of neutrophils to migrate and adhere, activate monocytes and\nenhance their antigen-presenting functions, and increase the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in vitro.\nMature DCs are characterized by an increase in the expression of molecules involved in antigen\npresentation and promote the formation of an immune synapse for signal transmission from antigen\npresenting cells to T lymphocytes and di \ufb00erentiation of activated T cells into T-e \ufb00ector cells [ 19\u201322].\nSome studies have shown that TLR activation in the DC presenting the antigen is critical for CD4+T\ncell activation and Th1 cell di \ufb00erentiation [23,24].\nA signi\ufb01cant increase in monocytes expressing CD83, the main marker of mature DCs, after","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":5741,"topic":"Fucoidan in Medical Treatments"}}

Composition of GMP-Grad e LMW Fucoidan (GMP Batch) \nThe objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a sterile drug product \nphysically and chemically stable taking into account the properties of the drug substance (fucoidan) and the intended route of administration (intravenous). A simple stable freeze-dried formulation \nincluding sodium chloride as matrix has been selected. The freeze-dried fucoidan is intended to be \nreconstituted with other ingredients (ascorbic ac id, stannous chloride) and radiolabeled before \nadministration. The GMP batch is a lyophilized powder containing 40 \u03bcg of fucoidan as drug \nsubstance and 8 mg of NaCl as dispersing agent. The GMP batch is filled in 6 R (9 mL) clear type I \nglass vial closed with a FluroTec\n\u00ae stopper, sealed with an aluminum  cap and blue flip-off capsule. \nManufacture and quality control of GMP batch for the clinical study were performed in compliance with good manufacturing practice at dully authoriz ed facilities. Further steps of reconstitution and \nradiolabeling are carried out at the hospital. The GMP batch is a white powder with 2.3% (m\/m) of \nwater content. The reconstituted solution in water is clear and colorless with 18 sub-visible particles higher than 10 \u03bcm and no one higher than 25 \u03bcm per container. The GMP batch exhibited a fucoidan \ncontent of 40.3 \u03bcg (i.e., 100.8% of nominal content) and a ve ry low content in free fucose (<0.1%). No \ninterference between the fucoidan and the other in gredient (NaCl) is expected. Finally, the GMP \nbatch complied with the required microbiologica l quality (no microbial growth and absence of \nbacterial endotoxins) (Table 2). \nFigure 1. 1D-1H-NMR spectra of 6 API batches.\n\nDocument 4254: Mar.

Signals describing the positions of secondary\nsulfate groups depend on the real conformation of monosaccharide units, which may be considerably\ndistorted in branched and heavily sulfated chains by neighboring substituents [160].\n5.2. NMR\nPreviously published articles have shown the valuable information presented by NMR for\nstructural elucidation and the numerous structural features of di \ufb00erent fucoidans from di \ufb00erent origins.\nOne- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR experiments of fucoidans, including1H- and13C-NMR,\ndemonstrate relatively well-interpreted spectra related to the sulfation pattern and glycosidic linkages.\nTwo approaches are usually applied in NMR experiments for obtaining valuable structure information,\ni.e., careful fractionation of crude fucoidan and \/or speci\ufb01c chemical modi\ufb01cation, such as desulfation.\nSuch treatments are aimed at producing regular or masked regular backbones, resulting in NMR\nspectra that can be interpreted [ 161]. An example of successful fractionation of a crude algal fucoidan\nto obtain a fucoidan fraction having regular structure, which was elucidated using NMR spectra,\nwas described by Bilan et al., where they obtained a regular fucoidan from the brown seaweed Fucus\ndistichus [162]. Fractionation is commonly conducted during the elution of puri\ufb01ed fucoidan from the\nanion-exchange column via the salting out mechanism using di \ufb00erent molar concentrations of NaCl, i.e.,\ngradient elution. A relationship was identi\ufb01ed between NaCl concentration and the molecular weight\nand sulfate content of the obtained fucoidan fraction, thereby facilitating the structural elucidation\nof various relatively simple fractions [ 38,119]. Moreover, fractionation may also carried out through\ndialysis membranes of di \ufb00erent molecular weight cuto \ufb00(MWCO), such as the fractionation of crude\nfucoidan into LMWFs and HMWFs [ 28]. For further information on such treatments, interested readers\ncan refer to the recently published review discussing the di \ufb00erent downstream processes applied\nin fucoidan production by Zayed et al. [ 54]. The production of oligomer fractions or fragments is\nconsidered a potential tool for polymer simpli\ufb01cation, i.e., enzymatic depolymerization, prior to\nNMR experiments. This step can be performed by enzymatic treatment of the native fucoidan with\nfucoidan-degrading enzymes, i.e., fucoidanases [ 161,163]. In addition, the application of fucoidanases\non desulfated or deacetylated fucoidans may result in more valuable structural information [ 34].\nThe desulfation and deacetylation of fucoidans is applied to produce simpler compounds, allowing\na comparison of the chemical shifts ( \u03b4, ppm) with standard sugars or the native polymer, especially\nbecause sulfate ester groups cause deshielding of neighboring protons and carbons, consequently\nappearing down\ufb01eld in the NMR spectra [ 8,139,163,164]. Some examples of fucoidans or sulfated\nfucans elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR are discussed below in detail.\n5.2.1. 1D NMR\nFucoidans from F. vesiculosus and Ascophyllum nodosum (Fucales) are the simplest form of algal\nfucoidans. They are polymers of alternating \u03b1-(1\u21923)- and \u03b1-(1\u21924)-linked l-fucopyranoside repeating\nunits ([\u21924)-\u03b1-l-Fuc p-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-l-Fuc p-(1\u21924)-\u03b1-l-Fuc p-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-l-Fuc p(1\u2192]) [35,43], where some\nstructural features can be elucidated from NMR spectra. In the1H-NMR spectrum, singlet peaks of the\nshielded protons at around 1.2 ppm are assigned to the \u2013CH 3groups (H-6) of the l-fucose monomer.\n\nDocument 1876: Mar.

The spectra displayed several signals that are indicative of the diversity and complexity\nof the fucoidans. However, several speci\ufb01c signals for fucose were observed in the1H NMR spectra\nfrom fucoidan fractions of both seaweeds (Figure 4), such as signals of anomeric protons (5\u20135.6 ppm),\nring protons (3.6\u20134.8 ppm), and methyl protons (1.2\u20131.5 ppm) regions [34].\nFigure 4.1H NMR spectra of fucoidan fractions.

Only the FeF1 fraction gave signals in the region of 5.8 ppm, characteristic for\nuronic acids, con\ufb01rming the presence of alginate impurities that are consistent with the monosaccharide\nand SEC analysis. Fraction FeF2 and FeF3 were purer than FeF1 and the characteristic peak of uronic\nacids was not observed. Indications of 1 \u21923 linked l-fucose were detected in the high-\ufb01eld signals at\n1.2\u20131.3 ppm with high intensity. In addition, signals with low intensity at around 1.4 ppm were also\nobserved, which con\ufb01rmed the presence of 1 \u21924 linked l-fucose, as anticipated [35,36].\n\nDocument 3384: Mar.

The small population because of a reduction of species\nrichness and abundance of pollinators, a change in the pattern of foraging behaviourof\ufb02ower-visiting insects, a reduction in pollinator visits per \ufb02ower or average\npollen loads per visit (Lamont et al. 1993 ; Jennersten 1988 ; Didham et al. 1996 ;\nAizen and Feinsinger 1994a ,b).\nHabitat Fragmentation\nThe habitat fragmentation will disturb interactions between plant \u2013pollinator\nresulting declines in plant reproduction. Additionally loss of one mutualistic partner\nin fragmented parts of the habitat has been predicted to causing extinctions withinthe fragment (Rathcke and Jules 1993 ; Kearns et al. 1998 ).\nWe predict high levels of pollination failure in rare plants with combinations of\nthese characteristics as, for example, in dioecious species with fragmented popu-lations pollinated by insects with a small foraging range. Spira ( 2001 ) considers that\ninsurance traits such as wind pollination, self pollination and asexual reproductionare unlikely to compensate rare plants in the long term for a continuous decline in\npollination and argues that the key to slowing the rate of species loss is habitat\npreservation. Of more immediate extinction threat are those rare plants withoutcompensation for pollination failure (importantly those requiring regular or highlevels of seed recruitment for survival), especially if reductions in pollination levelshave been brought about by recent environmental change. Pollination and seedlevels among plants in a community must reach a high enough threshold to accountfor reductions as a result of, for example, herbivory and loss of seed viability.Observations of successful pollination among threatened or rare plants alone,\nalthough providing evidence of viability, need to be accompanied by evidence of\nrecruitment from seed, because pollination levels recorded might not be suf \ufb01cient to\nachieve population replacement (Wilcock 2002 ; Spira 2001 ; Weekley and Race\n2001 ; Warburton et al. 2000 ; Bakker and Berendse 1999 ; Wilcock and Neiland\n1998 ).\nThus the understanding of the interactions between the levels of self-\ncompatibility and patterns of pollinator activity are mandatory to predict theimpacts of habitat fragmentation. The reproductive success is affected by frag-\nmentation depends upon interaction between the quantity and quality of pollen a\nplant receives and the level of self-compatibility (Aizen et al. 1994a ,2002 ).\nRepeated \ufb01res may affect population sizes and reduced plant densities, increased\npopulation fragmentation and even localized extinctions, especially for obligateseeders (Bradstock et al. 1996 ).\nThus we can say that habitat fragmentation includes three components (1) pure\nloss of habitat, (2) reduced fragment size, and (3) increased spatial isolation ofremnant fragments. In addition, small populations may be more prone to extinction\ndue to the loss of genetic variation.

Drugs 2023 ,21, 128 22 of 35\n4.1. Fucoidan Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy\nThere is considerable evidence that fucoidan potentiates cancer immunotherapy when\nused in combination with immunotherapeutic products. A recent study has shown that\nfucoidan supplements signi\ufb01cantly enhance the antitumor activities of PD-1 antibodies\nin vivo . Fucoidan consistently promotes the activation of tumor in\ufb01ltrating CD8+ T cells.\nTherefore, fucoidan combined with ICB therapy could be a promising strategy to treat\ncancer. The underlying mechanism for this enhanced immunotherapy may be related to the\nactivation of the JAK\/STAT pathway to stimulate T cell activation [ 18]. Fucoidan ( Ecklonia\ncava) combined with anti-PD-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody treatment (administered\nintranasally) successfully prolonged survival for mice with metastatic lung cancer, and the\nbody weight of the treated mice also increased. Furthermore, the combination treatment\ninhibits the in\ufb01ltration of B16 tumor cells into the lung and prevents the growth of metastatic\nmurine colon carcinoma CT-26 tumors in the lung [ 23]. When fucoidan was used together\nwith Nivolumab, it increased the effects of Nivolumab on prostate cancer cells by enhancing\nthe activity of human immune cells, and an additive effect was observed [ 136]. In a\nmurine tumor model, a combination of fucoidan and anti-PD-L1 antibody inhibited CT-26\ntumor growth more effectively than the anti-PD-L1 antibody. The study con\ufb01rmed that\nthe combination treatment with fucoidan enhanced anti-PD-L1 antibody-mediated anti-\ncancer immunity in the CT-26 carcinoma-bearing BALB\/c mice, providing direct in vivo\nevidence [21].\n4.2. Fucoidan Enhances the Ef\ufb01cacy of Immunotherapy via Novel Dosage Forms\nNanotechnology has emerged as a new approach to improve the ef\ufb01ciency of can-\ncer immunotherapy by targeting the drug delivery system and the metabolism of im-\nmunotherapeutic agents [ 151]. Two preclinical studies have shown that fucoidans ( Fucus\nvesiculosus and Laminaria japonica ) have the potential to be used to improve the ef\ufb01cacy\nof immunotherapy in cancer treatments [ 152,153]. When fucoidan ( Fucus vesiculosus ) is\npacked as a therapeutic nanomedicine, it is capable of augmenting the therapeutic index\nof combination checkpoint immunotherapy and reducing toxicity: Chiang et al. reported\nthe bene\ufb01cial therapeutic effects of fucoidan\u2013dextran-based magnetic nanomedicine (IO@\nFuDex3) conjugated with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1) and T cell activators (anti-CD3\nand anti-CD28). The IO@FuDex3 medicine helped the repair of the immunosuppressive\ntumor microenvironment and potentiated the effect of the anti-PD-L1 antibody [ 126].\nFucoidan ( Fucus vesiculosus )-based IL-2 delivery microcapsules, FPC2, loaded with IL-2\nshowed higher biological activity in ex vivo expansion of cytotoxic T cells than from Treg\nlymphocytes.

Smoking, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and \nHPV infection are the risk factors of oral cavity cancer \n(Blot et al., 1988; Hashibe et al., 2009). Although treatment \nmethods have developed over the last few decades, the \nprognosis for patients with OSCC is still moderate or poor. \nMoreover, the survival rate has only been moderately \nincreased in the past 30 years (Ragin et al., 2007). Standard \ntreatment methods for oral cancer compose of surgery, \nradiation therapy, or both. Chemotherapy can also be \nused as an additional treatment however, the controversial \noutcomes may occur due to its side effects. Only 50% of \npatients with locally advanced OSCC fail to respond to \nstandard therapies and develop recurrences and distant \nmetastases (Argiris et al., 2008; Leemans et al., 2011). \nHence, the development of optional chemotherapeutic \nagents, especially from natural resources, with more potent \nbut fewer adverse effects is still required.\nFucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide that Abstract\nObjective:  Many studies suggested that fucoidan has anticancer potential. The objective of the present study was \nto determine the cytotoxic effects and mechanism of cell death induced by fucoidan extracted from Fucus vesiculosus \non HSC-3 oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods:  HSC-3 cells were treated with 0, 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcg\/mL \nof fucoidan. Cell viability was measured using MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were measured with a flow \ncytometry-based assay. Chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were determined using Hoechst 33342 \nstaining. Mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) was determined using the JC-1 kit. The apoptotic, anti-apoptotic, \nand autophagic markers study were done by western blot analysis.  Results:  the viable cell number of treated HSC-3 \ncells was decreased. Moreover, treated cells were arrested in the G0\/G1 phase. Annexin V\/PI staining revealed that \nfucoidan could induce apoptosis in HSC-3 cells. Western blot analysis suggested the up-regulation of apoptotic markers \nincluding cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, Bax, and autophagic markers including LC3-II and Beclin-1 but down-\nregulation of anti-apoptotic markers, Bcl-2. Fucoidan could disturb \u0394\u03a8m and induce chromatin condensation with \nnuclear fragmentation.

In Vitro POS Release\nThe in vitro release is a valid test utilized in the development and optimization of\nformulations, as well as to predict the behavior of the formulation in vivo . The in vitro\nrelease stage simulates drug availability for absorption. The \ufb01rst step of absorption is\nbased on drug dissolution in the gastrointestinal or other \ufb02uid and then permeation across\nthe membrane. Absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs is mainly drug dissolution\ndependent, and in vitro models are used to predict the dissolution substance from a solid\ndrug delivery system and absorption from gastrointestinal tract [ 46]. Therefore, it is\nespecially important to use mucoadhesive dosage forms, which by extending the contact\ntime with the mucosa, prolong the residence time of the drug at the site of application, and\nas a result, retard drug dissolution and improve its bioavailability.\nStudies on POS release from designed microparticles in SVF (pH 4.2) used as an\nacceptor \ufb02uid showed that FUC concentration slightly affected the POS release pro\ufb01le\n(Figure 4a,b). Rapid drug burst occurred in F4\u2013F6 formulations, so that after 0.5 h, from\n59.77\u00b10.67% to 75.35 \u00b12.33% of POS was released. 80% of POS from formulation F4 was\nreleased already after 1 h, but from formulation F6\u2014after 3 h. The reason for this rapid\nPOS release could be the high solubility of FUC in the medium [ 4]. A signi\ufb01cant ( p< 0.05)\nextension in POS release was observed in the formulations GF4\u2013GF6, which is a result of\nGEL addition (Figure 4b). In formulations with lower FUC concentrations, no effect of\nFUC on drug release was observed (F4, F5; GF4, GF5). The most sustained POS release was\nobserved in the case of formulation containing GEL and the highest FUC concentration\n(GF6)\u2014after 0.5 h and 8 h, 59.77 \u00b10.67% and 65.34 \u00b14.10% of the active substance was\ndissolved in the medium, respectively. When 0.1 M HCl was used as the acceptor \ufb02uid,\na signi\ufb01cant extension of the POS release from all formulations was noted (Figure 5). In\nformulations with higher FUC concentration containing GEL (GF5 and GF6), prolonged\nPOS release was observed. Formulation GF6 was characterized by the most extended drug\npro\ufb01le\u2014after 8 h, only 33.81 \u00b15.58% of POS was released.\nGenerally, the swelling ratio of microparticles is a good indicator of drug release\npro\ufb01le. Indeed, with the increase or decrease in the swelling ability, release of the drug\noccurs rapidly or the pro\ufb01le is prolonged. Observed SR values are in correlation with\nthe POS release pro\ufb01les\u2014in the acidic medium microparticles swelled slower and longer\nthan in the SVF (pH 4.2). As FUC is characterized by high solubility, FUC microparticles\ndegraded faster than those containing GEL, therefore F4\u2013F6 formulations provided faster\nPOS release than GF4\u2013GF6. This might be caused by gel layer around the GEL-containing\nmicroparticles, which hindered water in\ufb02ux, ensured slower microparticles degradation\nand prolonged drug release [40].\n\nDocument 4438: Materials 2021 ,14, 4087 8 of 19\nthe spray drying process due to their high surface areas [ 30,33], and small particles of POS\nmight be removed by the air\ufb02ow to the \ufb01lter collector. The similar result was observed in\nPom\u00e1zi et al.\u2019s work, where meloxicam percent loading in mannitol-polyvinylpyrrolidone-\nbased microcomposites was signi\ufb01cantly higher (48.95% versus 27.74%) in comparison to\nthe drying process without polyvinylpyrrolidone application [34].\n3.2. Swelling and Mucoadhesion Ability\nThe swelling capacity of microparticles is a key element for both mucoadhesion and\ndrug release process. Adhesive polymers enable extended contact of drug with the mucosa\nin the appliaction site as a result of mucoadhesion process. The \ufb01rst, most important step of\nmucoadhesion phenomenon is the polymer swelling after contact with moisture. Swellable\npolymer becomes more plastic through relaxation of the polymer chains, which increases\nthe possibility of forming van der Waals or hydrogen bonds and enables their penetration\nthrough the mucus, and as a consequence\u2014adhesion. Moreover, the process of drug release\nstrictly depends on the ability of the polymer to swell [35].\nThe swelling study was performed for all formulations using SVF (pH 4.2) and 0.1 M\nHCl (pH 1.2) to imitate vaginal and stomach environment, respectively (Figure 2a,b). The\nresults obtained in both media showed that the higher FUC content in the composition\nresulted in better microparticle swelling ability. This is related with the fact that FUC\nsolutions are characterized by linear viscosity increase [ 36]. It was also observed that higher\npH (4.2) caused a decrease in swelling capacity, especially for formulations composed only\nfrom FUC. The same dependence between the degree of swelling and the medium pH was\nnoted for FUC\/chitosan beads (in pH 1.2 it was over 5, and in pH 6.0 it was less than 4) [ 37].\nLower swelling capacity was observed in the vaginal \ufb02uid (SVF, pH 4.2), which is related\nto the higher solubility of FUC in this medium. The SR graph of the fucospheres placed\nin SVF shows a sharp swelling peaks after 15 min with values from 0.88 \u00b10.03 for F1\nformulation to 1.93 \u00b10.24 for F3 formulation and reaches zero value after 30 min. As FUC\nsolutions are not highly viscous, it is not industrially used as thickening or gelling agent, as\nmany other polysaccharides\u2014only little gelling and \ufb01lm forming properties of FUC were\ndescribed [ 38]. It was observed that GEL presence in microparticles matrix signi\ufb01cantly\nincreased their swelling capacity in comparison to microparticles containing only FUC. It\nwas observed that the microparticles (GF1\u2013GF3) swelled gradually in the vaginal \ufb02uid,\nreaching maximum values after 90 min (from 1.73. \u00b10.23 in GF1 to 1.99 \u00b10.12 in GF3).\nThe addition of GEL, which solubility depends on temperature and which creates solutions\nwith higher viscosity than FUC, leads to the increased stability of microparticles and the\nlower rate of water penetration into the gel during the swelling process. This might be\nattributed to a high volume of swollen microparticles, which can absorb a lot of solvent\nduring the initial period of swelling [ 39]. The in\ufb02uence of GEL content on swelling capacity\nof scaffolds made of sodium alginate, GEL and FUC was also noted by Nguyen et al. They\nobserved the highest SR values in scaffolds in which the GEL share was the largest [ 40].\nThe swelling capacity of \ufb01lms made of micro\ufb01brillated chitin and GEL prepared by Li et al.\nchanged in similar way [41].\nAlthough FUC is stable over a wide pH range (from 5.8 to 9.5), in the acidic medium\nacid hydrolysis might occur, and a decrease in the FUC solubility is observed [ 4]. This\ncan be seen on the graph of swelling, where fucospheres placebo in 0.1 M HCl (pH 1.2)\npossessed the highest SR values after 30 min (from 0.73 \u00b10.07 for formulation F1 to\n1.67\u00b10.11 for F3).

Production of the aforementioned component\nin exceeded quantities are witnessed during immunological reactions. This as well is involved in\npathogenesis conditions such that, septic shock, cirrhosis states and in in\ufb02ammation [ 40]. Earlier\nreports have evidenced the role of nitric oxide as a part of both acute and chronic in\ufb02ammation.\nIalenti et al. (1992) , published on the degree of in\ufb02ammation to be reduced via the treatment of\ninhibitors of nitric oxide synthases where presence of L-arginine increased it [ 41]. Farrell et al. (1992),\nreported that patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis have increased levels of nitrite\nconcentrations in plasma and synovial \ufb02uid [ 42]. Nitric oxide is cytostatic and cytotoxic, further\nit can combine with oxygen derived radicals to produce components with ampli\ufb01ed toxicity [ 43].\nThus, increased production of nitric oxide could bring out detrimental e \ufb00ects on the neighboring\ncells. The results of this study exhibits F4 to reduce nitric oxide production (Griess assay) as well\nas the inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (Western blotting and mRNA analysis). The trend\nwas observed to be dose-dependent. COX is a membrane bound, heme-containing glycoprotein.\nTwo isoforms of the COX are found; COX-1 and COX-2, which are similar in structure and catalytic\nactivity. Although it was evident that COX-2 was the primary enzyme which control PGE 2synthesis\nvia arachidonic acid pathway in the in\ufb02ammation process [ 44]. F4 fraction was evident to be an\ninhibitor of COX-2 as well as PGE 2expression. The production and the release of pro-in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokines by macrophages were reported by Nathan (1987) [ 45]. These substances induce the migration\nof immune cells out of the circulation to the area of in\ufb02ammation as well as attract macrophages\nand neutrophils to destruct the invading species [ 45,46]. Waiters (1994), states that cytokine release\nand illness response is observed due to the bacterial cell wall (LPS), killed bacteria, tissue damage,\nand nerve damage stimulation [ 47]. In the present study, LPS induced macrophages expressed higher\namounts of pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine release (IL-1 \u03b2, IL-6, and TNF- \u03b1). F4 fraction had potential\nto down-regulate the mentioned levels dose-dependently, inhibiting the continuous transduction of\nin\ufb02ammatory signals which would lead to unhealthy e \ufb00ects.\nAlgae derived fucoidans have come to the light of attention recently with respect to its potential\ntherapeutic ability.

This may lead to neovascularization from the\nchoroid under and into the retina and to degeneration of the RPE and the photoreceptors; ROS =reactive\noxygen species; VEGF =vascular endothelial growth factor.\nAMD is a multifactorial disease, and its pathogenesis is still under investigation. Risk factors\nare old age, certain genetic polymorphisms, and environmental factors such as smoking or diet [ 7].\nPathological pathways include lipid dysregulation, in\ufb02ammation, oxidative stress, and pro-angiogenic\nsignaling [3,8,9] (Figure 1). The latter two will be discussed in more detail.\nOxidative stress is a constant condition of the retina. Due to its function as a light detector, the retina\nis constantly subjected to (highly energetic) visible light. Furthermore, due to the high oxygen demand\nof the retina, the oxygen tension surrounding the cells is very high [ 10]. Photoreceptors and the RPE\nproduce considerable amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) in their mitochondria [ 11]. Furthermore,\nthe concentration of lipids is high because of the abundance of membranes in the photoreceptor\u2019s\nouter segments (and their fragments, phagocytosed by the RPE). Light waves, especially blue light\nillumination, can induce reactive oxygen species, and reactive oxygen species can peroxidize lipids\nand other cellular molecules [ 11\u201313]. During aging, the RPE accumulates lipofuscin which can act as\nan additional photosensitizer. The RPE has a high stress tolerance which decreases with age. A high\ndegree of oxidative stress and reduced activation of oxidative stress protection pathways lead to RPE\ncell death and can induce AMD-like features in animal models [14\u201319].\nOxidative stress is considered a major pathomechanism for all forms of AMD. Pathologic\nangiogenesis, on the other hand, is indicative of the exudative form of this disease. Here, vessels arise\nfrom the choroid and grow beneath or into the retina [ 4]. These vessels are leaky and can cause edema,\nand may turn into \ufb01brotic scar tissue [ 20]. Retinal tissues degenerate rapidly in exudative AMD,\nwhich is responsible for the majority of severe loss of visual acuity in AMD [ 21]. Angiogenesis is a\ncomplex procedure involving several angiogenic factors. The major angiogenic factor in health and\ndisease is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [ 22]. VEGF is involved in several retinal diseases,\nsuch as retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration [ 23].\nIt is secreted by a variety of cells of the retina, but regarding AMD, the RPE is the most important\nsource [ 2]. VEGF secretion by the RPE is enhanced by many stimuli, such as hypoxia, oxidative stress,\nand pro-in\ufb02ammatory stimuli [ 24\u201327]. Enhanced VEGF secretion of the RPE combined with defects in\nthe underlying Bruch\u2019s membrane induce the growth of pathologic vessels from the choroid (choroidal\nneovascularizations (CNV)) [ 23,28]. For exudative AMD, anti-VEGF therapy has become the gold\nstandard [ 5]. However, while vessels regress and some visual acuity may be won under this therapy,\n\nDocument 594: Mar.

Interestingly, primates\nincluding humans, in contrast to other mammals, have a speci\ufb01c area in their retina, called the macula.\nThis region is anatomically speci\ufb01ed to facilitate high acuity vision [7].\n1.2. Age-Related Macular Degeneration\nAge-related macular degeneration is the major cause of blindness and severe visual impairment in the\nindustrialized countries [ 8]. While the early forms of AMD are generally asymptomatic, the two late forms\nof AMD are associated with a devastating loss of vision. In the late \u201cdry\u201d form of the disease, geographic\natrophy , extensive areas of the macula display a degeneration of the photoreceptors and the RPE. In the\nexudative \u201cwet\u201d form of AMD, vessels grow from the choroid beneath and into the retina. These vessels\nare immature and leaky , inducing tissue-destructive effects on photoreceptors and RPE. In addition, fluid\naccumulation under the macula occurs. The pathogenesis of AMD is so far not completely elucidated,\nbut several factors have been implicated to contribute [ 9,10]. Environmental factors such as smoking and\ngenetic susceptibilities have been shown to be significantly associated with the development of AMD.\nIn addition, oxidative stress [ 11], as well as inflammatory factors, has been implicated [ 9]. Here, the\ncomplement system is of highest interest, as most genetic susceptibilities are connected to the complement\nsystem\u2014mainly with the alternative pathway of the complement system [12,13].\nIn addition, activation of the resident microglia of the retina is currently discussed as a potential\npathogenic factor in AMD, though its contribution is not clear [ 6]. Similarly, the migration of\nmacrophage in the subretinal space is discussed as a possible pathogenic factor, as a healthy retina is\ndevoid of macrophages [14].\nFor the development of exudative AMD, the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as the most important factor and considered to be prerequisite for the development of\nchoroidal neovascularizations (CNV) (see below). Anti-VEGF therapies are the current gold standard\nfor wet AMD treatment [ 8]. However, these treatments hold no cure for the disease, and the inhibitors,\ninjected intravitreally, have to be given on a regular base. Visual decline is common even under\ntherapy [15]. New treatment options are clearly warranted.\n1.3. Diabetic Retinopathy\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia, either resulting from\na de\ufb01ciency of insulin secretion, e.g., by autoimmunogenic destruction of the insulin producing\npancreatic cells, or by an impaired insulin action. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent\ncomplication of diabetes, and one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness in the\nworking population, both in the developed and the developing world [16].\nEarly signs of DR include microaneurysms, the loss of pericytes from retinal capillaries, and a\nbreakdown of the blood-retinal-barrier, as well as retinal hemorrhages and exudates [ 17,18]. The most\nimportant factor in developing DR is the blood glucose level. In fact, early glycemic control may have\nlasting bene\ufb01cial effects [ 19]. Hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress and low grade in\ufb02ammation. [ 17].\nMicroangiopathy due to hyperglycemia leads to vascular leakage, causing edema. Another important\nrisk factor for DR is hypertension [ 20]. In diabetic retinopathy, retinal pericytes and endothelial\ncells may die of apoptosis; here, reactive oxygen species concomitant with NF \u03baB activation have\nbeen described to be of importance [ 16].

Thus, the optimal effective\nanticoagulant and antithrombotic agents, as well as their doses, remain uncertain.\nA separate problem is the interaction of antithrombotic and anticoagulant drugs with\nspeci\ufb01c drugs in COVID-19 treatments, since not all drugs are compatible. An individual\napproach to the patient is recommended, aimed at the optimal risk\/bene\ufb01t ratio of various\nantithrombotic strategies, taking into account the underlying hypercoagulable state.\nTherefore, the treatment of patients and prevention of thrombosis in COVID-19 re-\nquires solving issues related to the need to \ufb01nd new effective anticoagulants, as well as\ntheir optimal dosage. In this regard, the search for new effective anticoagulants remains\nrelevant. In this aspect, the sulfated PSs of seaweed are of interest.\nDiagnostic criteria for assessing hemostasis are the following coagulation-based labo-\nratory parameters: both basic tests, including PT with international normalized ratio (INR),\nAPTT, TT, \ufb01brinogen level, platelet count, and extended parameters\u2014AT III and D-dimer\nlevel. So, the COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) markers are prolongation of APTT\nand PT, hypo\ufb01brinogenemia or hyper\ufb01brinogenemia, thrombocytopenia, a decrease or\nincrease in AT III level, progressive decrease in the \ufb01brinogen level, and an increase in\nthe concentration of D-dimer. An increase in the D-dimer level correlates with higher\nmortality, and rapidly increasing hypo\ufb01brinogenemia foreshadows the development of\nDIC [ 3,72,114,115]. In general, such parameters as D-dimer, PT, platelet count, and \ufb01b-\nrinogen are important predictors of critical conditions, and are of particular prognostic\nsigni\ufb01cance in patients with COVID-19.\nAs follows from our review, the major therapeutic role of seaweed sulfated PSs, as\nwell as heparin, is in the inhibition of clot formation. Due to anticoagulant, antithrombotic,\nand \ufb01brinolytic activities, it is possible to use PSs both for the purposes of thrombosis\nprevention and for thrombolysis. The mechanisms of anticoagulant and antithrombotic\nactivity of seaweed sulfated PSs include the impact on both the factors of the extrinsic\nand intrinsic coagulation pathways, and the \ufb01nal stage of coagulation\u2014the conversion\nof \ufb01brinogen to \ufb01brin under the thrombin in\ufb02uence. Anticoagulant activity of PS can be\nassociated with plasma AT III, and antithrombotic activity\u2014with an increase in the level of\nt-PA and competitive binding to the t-PA-PAI-1 complex. In this regard, seaweed sulfated\nPSs can contribute to normalization of the coagulation-based laboratory parameters (APTT,\nPT, AT III, D-dimer, and \ufb01brinogen level); i.e., correction of hemostasis disorders in COVID-\n19 patients.\nThe use of seaweed sulfated PSs, as well as heparin drugs, for the prevention and\ntreatment of thrombosis is promising both at the stage of hospitalization of patients, and\nafter discharge from the hospital. PSs can also be recommended for use in the outpatient\nsetting for a long time.\nIn addition to being strong anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and \ufb01brinolytics, PSs\nare also able to exhibit other effects that are useful in the treatment of viral infections,\naccounting for known data on their antiviral activity [ 116\u2013119], anti-in\ufb02ammatory activ-\nity, and ability to reduce the proin\ufb02ammatory cytokine production and other bene\ufb01cial\neffects [ 17,56,120\u2013124]. Such a wide range of biological activity is due to the chemical\nnature of PSs. As is known, seaweed sulfated PSs, as well as heparins, are mimetics of\nglycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

The product of fermentation is ethanol. The\nethanol is drained from the tank and pumped to a holding tank\nto be fed to a distillation unit. Ethanol was produced with microal-\ngal photosynthesis and intracellular anaerobic fermentation [91].\n3.5.1.2. Biomethane. The concept of using algae as a fuel was \ufb01rst\nproposed by Meier [55] for the production of methane gas from\nthe carbohydrate fraction of cells. This idea was further developed\nby Oswald and Golueke [92], who introduced a conceptual techno-\neconomic engineering analysis of digesting microalgal biomass\ngrown in large raceway ponds to produce methane gas. In the\n1970s, as the cost of conventional fuels began rising rapidly, the\npossibility of using algae as a fuel source received renewed atten-\ntion. A more detailed design and engineering analysis of this con-\ncept was carried out by Benemann et al. [93], who concluded\nthat such systems could produce biogas competitively with pro-\njected fossil fuel prices.\nAnaerobic digestion of bio-wastes occurs in the absence of air,\nthe resulting gas called as biogas is a mixture consisting mainly\nof methane and carbon dioxide. Biogas is a valuable fuel which is\nproduced in digesters \ufb01lled with the feedstock like dung or sewage.\nThe digestion is allowed to continue for a period of from ten days\nto a few weeks.\nAlgal biomass can be used for biogas production. In Poland,\nthere are numerous active biogas installations, from large-scale\nones to small ones fed with straw and green plant fuel that serve\na few farms; so far, however, algae have not been used as such a\nfuel. Some macroalgal species like Macrocystis pylifera , and genera\nsuch as Sargassum ,Laminaria ,Ascophyllum ,Ulva ,Cladophora ,Chae-\ntomorpha and Gracilaria , have been explored as potential methane\nsources [94]. But in spite of the large seaweed biomass in various\nregions of the world, anaerobic digestion for biogas generation ap-\npears to be unsatisfactory and therefore uneconomic [95,96] .\nAnaerobic digestion of the algal waste produces carbon dioxide,\nmethane and ammonia. Left over nitrogen and phosphorus com-\npounds can be reused as fertilizer to the algal process. Using the\nmethane as an energy source can further enhance energy recovery\nfrom the process.\nThe researchers highlighted some key issues to be addressed in\nmicroalgal production:\n\u2013 Sodium (in salt) can inhibit the anaerobic digestion process\nwhen using marine algae, although researchers suggest suitable\nbacteria (anaerobic digesters) can adapt.\n\u2013 Digestion of the algae can be enhanced and the methane yield\nincreased by physical or chemical pre-treatment to break down\ncell walls and make the organic matter in the cells more\naccessible.\n\u2013 The nitrogen content of certain algae can be high, resulting in\ngreater levels of ammonia which can also inhibit the digestion\nprocess. One strategy to overcome this problem uses a \u2018co-\ndigestion\u2019 process, whereby other organic waste, which is\nhigher in carbon and lower in nitrogen, is added to the algal\nwaste.\n3.5.1.3. Anaerobic bio-hydrogen production. In microbial fermenta-\ntion of biomass, different waste materials can be used as sub-\nstrates. A new and unique process has been developed when\nsubstrates such as carbohydrates are fermented by a consortium\nof bacteria; they produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Highly\nconcentrated organic waste water is one of the most abundantly\navailable biomass which can be exploited for microbial conversion\ninto hydrogen [97]. Municipal solid wastes and digested sewage\nsludge have the potential to produce large amount of hydrogen\nby suppressing the production of methane by introducing low volt-age electricity into the sewage sludge. The substrate from the aci-\ndogenesis of fruit and vegetable market wastes gives higher\nhydrogen evolution rates (about threefold) compared to synthetic\nmedium.

Conclusions\nIn this study, four fucoidans (F1, F2, DF1 and DF2) were puri\ufb01ed and degraded from\ncrude fucoidans of Sargassum , physicochemically characterized, and tested for antitumor\nactivity in vitro . It was discovered that fucoidan\u2019s molecular weight reduced after degrada-\ntion even though its structure and chemical composition were different before and after\ndegradation. Under the same conditions, the inhibitory rate of the fucoidan DF2, which\nhad a lower molecular weight and the greatest concentration of polysaccharide, sulfate, and\nfucose, increased to 71.63% after 48 h. The IC 50of DF2 against HepG2, MCF-7, Hela, and\nA549 tumor cells was 2.2 mg\/mL, which was lower than the IC 50against other components.\nMoreover, Flow cytometry demonstrated that HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells might\nundergo apoptosis when exposed to fucoidan of Sargassum. Therefore, the antitumor\nactivity of Sargassum fucoidan was related to its L-fucose, sulfate content and molecular\nweight, with the most signi\ufb01cant inhibitory effect being on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma\ncells. These results suggest that Sargassum fucoidan has anti-hepatocarcinogenic poten-\ntial, but its potential conformational relationship and anti-tumor mechanism need to be\nfurther investigated.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, writing-original draft, B.L.; writing-review, Z.W.; project\nadministration, editing and funding acquisition, J.C.; investigation, methodology and software, X.C.\nand J.L.; supervision, formal analysis, conceptualization and resources, Y.L., R.L., X.L., B.S., K.-L.C.\nand S.Z.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Project of Science and Technology of Zhanjiang City (grant\nnumber: 2020A01034 and 2022A01045), Guangdong Basic and the Applied Basic Research Foundation\n(grant number: 2020A1515010860 and 2021A1515012455), the Guangdong Ocean University Innova-\ntion Program (grant number: 230419100), the Nanhai Youth Scholar Project of Guangdong Ocean\nUniversity (grant number: 002029002009), the Scienti\ufb01c Research Foundation of Guangdong Ocean\nUniversity (grant number: R17034), the Guangdong Province Ordinary Universities Characteristic\nInnovation Project (grant number: 2020KTSCX051), and the Guangdong Provincial Department of\nEducation and the Innovative Team Program of High Education of the Guangdong Province (grant\nnumber: 2021KCXTD021).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nCon\ufb02icts of Interest: The authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

The  intervention  therapy\nusing weight-reducing drugs, accompanied by lifestyle modification, is a strategy for the treatment of obesity. In\nthe present study, we explored the role of fucoidan, a seaweed compound, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity\nin mice. We found that fucoidan treatment significantly reduced the body fat and caused redistribution of visceral\nand  subcutaneous  fat  in  HFD-fed  mice.  Meanwhile,  fucoidan  treatment  inhibited  adipocyte  hypertrophy  and\ninflammation in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that fucoidan may be a promising treatment for\nobesity and obesity-induced complications.\nKeywords: obesity, adipose tissue, fucoidan, inflammation\n \nIntroduction\nObesity,  an  escalating  global  pandemic  featuring\nthe  accumulation  of  excess  body  fat[1\u2013 2],  is  closely\nrelated  to  the  development  of  cardiovascular  disease,\ninsulin  resistance  (IR),  type  2  diabetes,  and\nnonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease  (NAFLD)[3].  The\nexcess energy stored in adipocytes leads to adipocyte\nhypertrophy  and  macrophages  infiltration  in  adipose\ntissues[4\u20135]. Hypertrophic adipocyte secrets adipokines\nincluding adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\n(TNF-\u03b1)  and  interleukin-6  (IL-6),  which  can  change\ninsulin  activity  in  adipose  tissues,  liver,  and\nmuscles[6\u2013 7].  Meantime,  obesity  also  induces  chronicin\ufb02ammation,  leading  to  the  development  of  elated\nmetabolic  dysfunction  such  as  IR,  NAFLD,  and\ncardiovascular diseases[4]. Thus, both fat accumulation\nand  inflammation  are  key  contributors  to  the\npathogenesis  of  obesity  and  its  related  metabolic\ndysfunction.\nAs a complex sulfated polysaccharide, fucoidan has\nbeen  widely  investigated  for  its  anti-oxidative,  anti-\ntumogenestic,  and  anti-inflammatory  effects[8\u2013 9].  It\nreduces body weight gain in the mice fed with a high-\nfat diet (HFD) and inhibits lipid accumulation in 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes[10\u201311]. Our previous studies have shown\nthat  fucoidan  prevents  obesity-associated  high  blood\npressure[12].  However,  whether  fucoidan  has  impacts\n\u25b3These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\u2709Corresponding authors: Qi Chen and Xudong Zhu, Key Laboratory\nof Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease, Collaborative\nInnovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medi-\ncine,  Nanjing  Medical  University,  101  Longmian  Road,  Nanjing,\nJiangsu 211166, China.

However,  increased  adi-\npogenesis  in  the  adipose  tissue  is  accompanied  by\nreduction in pro-inflammatory adipokines[36]. Further-\nmore,  large  fat  cells  are  under  hypoxic  stress,  which\naugments  inflammatory  cell  infiltration.  The  smaller\nfat  cells  produced  in  adipogenesis  can  decrease  the\ninflammation  in  adipose  tissues[37].  In  our  study,  the\ndecrease  in  fat  mass  was  accompanied  by  shrinking\ndiameter  of  the  adipocyte  and  inhibition  of  anti-\nadipogenesis effects in fucoidan-treated HFD mice. In\nconclusion,  pro-adipogenesis  may  be  a  possible\nmechanism  for  fucoidan  to  prevent  obesity  and\nobesity-related  metabolic  dysfunction,  but  more\nexperiments are needed to prove it.\nIn this study, we show that fucoidan inhibits murine\nbody  fat  accumulation  and  adipose  inflammation\ninduced  by  HFD.  Combined  with  our  previous\ndiscovery  that  fucoidan  inhibits  obesity-associated\nhigh  blood  pressure[12],  fucoidan  may  be  used  as  an\nnew anti-obesity agent. Certainly, more studies on its\nefficacy in human beings are needed in the future. \nAcknowledgments\nThis  work  was  supported  by  the  grants  from  theNational  Natural  Science  Foundation  of  China\n(81830011,  81670418,  and  91739304  to  Q.C.,\n81770417 to X.Z., 81870371 to J.B., and 81670263 to\nX.L.);  and  the  Natural  Science  Foundation  of  the\nJiangsu  Higher  Education  Institutions  of  China\n(18KJA310003 to J.B. and 15KJA310001 to X.L.).\nReferences\nWang YC, McPherson K, Marsh T, et al.

The anti-inflammation effects of\nfucoidan have been reported in several cell types. For\nexample,  fucoidan  inhibits  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-\ninduced  inflammation  in  macrophages[25] and\nmicroglial cells[26]. Our results indicated that fucoidan\nameliorated  inflammation  in  both  adipocytes  and\nmacrophages insulted by PA. Macrophages in adipose\ntissues can affect insulin signaling in adipocytes via a\nparacrine  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  obesity,\npromoting  the  progression  of  IR  and  obesity-related\nmetabolic diseases[27\u201328]. Adipocyte hypertrophy causes\nlocal  hypoxia,  which  drives  the  inflammatory\nresponses  in  both  macrophages  and  adipocytes.\nMeantime,  innate  immune  signaling  in  adipocytes  is\nactivated  by  FFA  or  other  cytokines.  This  processtriggers  the  infiltration  of  inflammatory  cells[29\u2013 32].\nPreadipocytes in obese adipose fat have increased pro-\ninflammatory  cytokines[33],  indicating  the  role  of\nadipocytes in the obesity-induced inflammation. Thus,\nthe  suppressing  effect  of  fucoidan  on  inflammatory\nresponses  in  both  macrophages  and  adipocytes\nprovides  an  aggravating  beneficial  effect  against\nobesity.  Petrus et  al have  been  reported  that  reduced\nglycolytic  rates  could  inhibit  pro-inflammatory  gene\nexpression  in  adipocytes[34].  Fucoidan  has  been\nreported  to  improve  mitochondrial  TCA  cycle  in\nrats[35].  In  our  study,  fucoidan  also  inhibited  the\ninflammation  of  adipocytes  by  reducing  glycolytic\nlevel and increasing TCA level.\nLarger  adipocytes  tend  to  secrete  more  pro- \n**\n****\n** ******\n**\n*******\n**\n***************** ******************\n************\n********* *** ****** ******\n*** ***\n*** ***Control\nFucoidanControl\nFucoidan\nPA\nPA+FucoidanControl\nFucoidan\nPA\nPA+FucoidanPrimary murine adipocytes\nA B C D\nE F\nG H I JMurine BMDMsTnf Il1b Il6\nTnf Il1b Il6 Il10Adipoq\nGlucose OligoOligo2-DGFCCP Rote+AA\nTime (minutes) Time (minutes)Relative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA levelRelative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA level\nRelative mRNA levelECAR (mpH\/min)OCR (pmol\/min)60\n50\n40\n30\n2010\n050\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0300\n200\n100\n0300\n200\n100\n0\n400\n300\n200\n100\n02.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n2.5\n2.0\n1.51.00.50\n0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20\n2040\n4060\n6080\n80100\n100 15\n10\n5\n040\n30\n20\n10\n0 0 0\n \n \nFig. 4   Fucoidan treatment suppressed inflammation of adipocytes and macrophages.

Fucoidan is a polysaccharide derived from brown seaweeds and haslong been used as an ingredient in some dietary supplement products. Although fucoidan has been known to have anti-cancer activity, the anti-metastatic effects and its detailed mechanism of actions have been poorly understood. Therefore,\nthe aims of this study were to demonstrate the anti-metastatic functions of fucoidan and its mechanism of action using\nA549, a highly metastatic human lung cancer cell line.\nMethods and Principal Findings: Fucoidan inhibits the growth of A549 cells at the concentration of 400 mg\/ml. Fucoidan\ntreatment of non-toxic dose (0\u2013200 mg\/ml) exhibits a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the invasion and\nmigration of the cancer cell via decreasing its MMP-2 activity. To know the mechanism of these inhibitory effects, Western\nblotting was performed. Fucoidan treatment down-regulates extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1\/2) andphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013Akt\u2013mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathways. Furthermore, fucoidandecreases the cytosolic and nuclear levels of Nuclear Factor-kappa B (p65).\nConclusions\/Significance: The present study suggests that fucoidan exhibits anti-metastatic effect on A549 lung cancer\ncells via the down-regulation of ERK1\/2 and Akt-mTOR as well as NF-kB signaling pathways. Hence, fucoidan can beconsidered as a potential therapeutic reagent against the metastasis of invasive human lung cancer cells.\nCitation: Lee H, Kim J-S, Kim E (2012) Fucoidan from Seaweed Fucus vesiculosus Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cell via PI3K-Akt-mTOR\nPathways.

The development of cancer metastasis consists of multipleprocesses, in which cancer cells first detach from the primarytumor, invade surrounding tissues and intravasate into blood and\/or lymphatic systems and extravasate from the vasculature andsubsequently settle and colonize at the target organs. Matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in tumor metastasis,where MMPs degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such ascollagen, proteoglycan, elastin, laminin, and fibronectin [1,2].Among them, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B)are expressed abundantly in various malignant cancers anddegrade type IV collagen, which is a major component of thebasement membrane. Generally, MMP-2 is over-expressedconstitutively in highly metastatic cancers, whereas MMP-9 isinduced by some stimulating factors such as inflammatorycytokines, epidermal growth factor and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate [3]. Therefore, MMP-2 may play a more important role inthe cancer cells migration and invasion.Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world\n\nDocument 5075: These results proposed the therapeutic potential of fucoidan as an\nanti-metastatic agent in human lung cancer patients.\nFucoidan Reduces the Nuclear Translocation of NF- kB\nNF-kB pathway has been demonstrated to rely upon sequen-\ntially activated kinase cascades [23]. On activation, NF- kB\ntranslocates from cytoplasm into nucleus and regulates theexpression of a wide variety of target genes, including MMPs[5]. Since NF- kB can play a key role in MMP-2 gene expression,\nthe effects of fucoidan was assessed on I kBaand NF- kB signal\ntransduction. As shown in Figure 8A and 8B, fucoidan inhibitedthe phosphorylation of I kBain a concentration-dependent\nmanner, whereas the total I kBawas inversely increased by\nfucoidan. Being consistent with this, phospho-p65, an indicator of\nNF-kB activation through I kBadegradation, was decreased by the\ntreatment of fucoidan (Fig. 8A and 8C), which is accompanied bythe increase of total p65 in the cytosolic fraction and its decrease innuclear fraction (Fig. 8A and 8D). The results demonstrated that\nfucoidan significantly inhibited activation of NF- kB in A549 cells.\nDiscussion\nIt is well known that MMPs provide an access for tumor cells to\nthe vascular and lymphatic vessels, which support tumor growth\nand constitute an escape route for further dissemination [24].\nFurthermore, MMPs promote malignant transformation in earlystages of cancer and suppress cancer cell apoptosis and enhanceangiogenesis as well as destroy chemokines balance by host anti-tumor defense system [25]. Accordingly, blocking of MMPs\nactivity and expression may lead to the development of effective\ntherapy in metastatic cancer patients. Although many scientistshave made great efforts to develop potential anticancer agents ofMMPs inhibitors, most clinical trials have not been successfully\ncompleted yet [26].\nIn search of efficacious metastatic suppressors, a wide variety of\nnatural products and their pharmacological ingredients can bea good source of finding promising candidates, having several\nadvantages over synthetic chemicals on side effects and pharma-\ncophore diversity. Some of them from various natural resourceshave been already characterized as potential therapeutics withanti-metastatic activity [27]. Among them, fucoidan has beenrevealed to possess anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on\nMCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not human mammary epithelial\ncells (HMECs) [28]. Recently, fucoidan has been demonstrated toinhibit metastasis via MMP-2\/ 29 suppression as well as subdue\nthe expression and secretion of a vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF) [14]. The anti-metastatic activity of fucoidan was\nalso proven in the animal model of experimental transplantedLewis lung carcinoma (LLC) [13]. However, the inhibitorymechanism on cancer metastasis has not been clearly elucidatedin detail yet. For the first time, in this study, it is at least partly\nidentified the anti-metastatic molecular mechanism of fucoidan.\nThe status of cell viability was assessed using MTT assay in the\nabsence or presence of various concentrations of fucoidan.\nFucoidan inhibited cell growth at 400 mg\/ml but not at between\n0 to 200 mg\/ml, at which it effectively inhibited migration and\ninvasion without significant cytotoxic effect. Therefore, the anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects of fucoidan observed from thepresent study were not dependent on its anti-proliferation effect.\nThe enhancement of MMP-2 activity has been well characterized\nin highly metastatic human lung cancer cells [29]. However,MMP-9 is still inconclusive, since there is only an extremely lowlevel of MMP-9 detected in A549 human lung cancer cells. Basedon our present study, the anti-metastatic effects of fucoidan appear\nFigure 7.

Drugs 2021 ,19, 265 5 of 17\nFucoidan reduces cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting normal mitosis and cell cycle\nregulation [ 67]. When fucoidan was injected into C57 mice with transplanted Lewis\nlung adenocarcinoma cells, it was observed that the number of tumor masses and lung\nmetastases was signi\ufb01cantly lower than that in cyclophosphamide treated mice, indicating\nthat metastasis and tumor cell growth are effectively inhibited by fucoidan [24].\n\u2022 Activation of tumor cell apoptosis signals:\nFucoidan leads to the activation of tumor cell apoptosis signals, leading to anticancer\neffects [ 68]. HT-29 and HCT116 human colon cancer cells were cocultured with fucoidan\nextracted from Fucus vesiculosus . The results showed that fucoidan induced caspase-3, -7,\n-8, and -9 activation, chromatin condensation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)\ncleavage [69].\n\u2022 Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) formation:\nVEGF formation can be inhibited by fucoidan, which leads to angiogenesis suppres-\nsion, interruption in the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor, tumor volume\nreduction, and inhibition of the spread of cancer cells [ 70,71]. Fucoidan was administered\nto mice implanted with Lewis lung cancer cells, and the results showed reduced VEGF\nlevels in serum and lung tissue compared to those in non-FUCs [ 7]. Fucoidan or fucoidan\npersulfate can inhibit VEGF165 mitosis and chemotaxis in human umbilical vein endothe-\nlial cells by inhibiting VEGF165 at cell surface receptors [ 71,72]. Fucoidan also inhibits\ncell-induced neovascularization of human prostate cancer (DU-145) as observed in mice\nwith transplanted B16 melanoma cells. Thus, these results showed that the antitumor\nactivity of fucoidan is related to its anti-angiogenic effect [73,74].\n\u2022 Stimulation of NK cells and T lymphocytes:\nFucoidan activates the immune system by elevating the actions of NK cells and T\nlymphocytes to target cancer cells. Mice transplanted with NB4 (acute promyelocytic\nleukemia cells) were fed fucoidan, which led to an increased killing activity of cancer cells\nby NK cells [ 75].

Discussion\nWe demonstrated that F-fucoidan, a polysaccharide in Saccharina japonica , ameliorates\ntype I hypersensitivity by secreting Gal9 in blood by oral administration but not intraperi-\ntoneally [ 10]. Furthermore, it was con\ufb01rmed that its oral administration eliminated IgE on\nthe surface of mast cells and improved allergies even after allergen sensitization [ 11]. Fu-\ncoidan can be seen as an attractive compound that can help to prevent or improve allergies\nwithout affecting Th1\/Th2 balance. However, in order to expect the bene\ufb01ts demonstrated\nby fucoidan, humans must consume a large amount of seaweed, as much as 12 g per day.\nAs a possible solution to this problem, we hypothesized that the intake of fucoidan\ncould be reduced by combining food components. Recently, polyphenols are attrac-\ntive phytochemicals exerting some physiological activities such as allergic inhibition.\nSingh et al. [ 16] have reviewed the effects of polyphenols on two critical reactions of\nallergic responses, sensitization to a given allergen and re-exposure to it. Quercetin low-\nered mast cell degranulation of bone-marrow mast cells (BMMCs) and human cultured\nmast cells, while no effect was observed for the glycosylated form of quercitrin [ 17,18].\nLuteolin can inhibit mast cell degranulation as well as its structurally related polyphenol\nquercetin at lower concentrations [ 19]. Kaempferol suppressed \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity\nfrom RBL-2H3 cells when Caco-2 cells in co-culture system composed of Caco-2 cells in\napical side and RBL-2H3 cells in basolateral side were stimulated with kaempferol, but its\nactivity was lower than quercetin [ 20]. Cao et al. [ 21] reported that kaempferol is used as\nParkinson disease protein 7 modulator for preventing mast cell-mediated allergic disorders\nthrough attenuating Lyn activation. While promising evidence has been found for single\nfood factors, there have been reports that combination of food factors is also bene\ufb01cial,\nincluding mixtures of vitamin D3, quercetin, and Perilla frutescens , and mixtures of vitamin\nD3 and Lactobacillus reuteri [22]. Similarly, we had con\ufb01rmed that simultaneous intake of\nEnterococcus faecalis IC-1 and luteolin suppressed allergy in OVA-induced allergic mice [ 14].\nAs shown in Figure 1, it was found that vegetable extracts of onion and Welsh onion\nenhanced the allergic effect of fucoidan while red bell paper, storage ginger, and radish did\nnot. This difference in the activity was presumably due to the kind or content of polyphe-\nnols contained in the vegetables. As a result of analyzing the amount of polyphenols in\nvegetable extracts by HPLC (Figure 2), it was con\ufb01rmed that the vegetable extracts that\nshowed allergy-suppressing effects contained high amounts of quercetin glycosides and\nkaempferol glycosides when administered orally at the same time as fucoidan at an amount\nthat did not cause allergy suppression. In order to search for vegetables that contain\nhigher amounts of quercetin and\/or kaempferol, HPLC analysis was performed on 56\nkinds of vegetables and fruits and each peak was assigned with a previously constructed\npolyphenol library [ 23]. The results indicated that broccoli and okra were identi\ufb01ed as can-\ndidate vegetables, because they were the most quercetin- and kaempferol-rich vegetables\namong 56 vegetables and fruits, respectively. Furthermore, PCA reactions were performed\non their extracts. Oral administration of 30 mg of broccoli and 35 mg of okra alone did","topic":"Others"}}

Compared to \nthe naproxen group (69.8 \u00b1  29.3 mg\/g of tissue and 214.2 \u00b1  19.5 nmol\/g of tissue, respectively) , the \ngroup pretreated with PLS (90 mg\/kg) did not show significant  inhibition of GSH level depletion  \n(92.5 \u00b1  42.2 mg\/g of tissue) or reduction in the concentration of MDA (198.1 \u00b1  38.6 nmol\/g of tissue) \nin the small intestine (Figures 4 and 5).  \nAntioxidant compounds play an important role in various pathological conditi ons, including \ninflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer [39,40]. It has been systematically reported in \nliterature that PLSs that show antioxidant activity, such as those extracted from marine algae, protect \nagainst cell death due to their abil ity to degrade excessive ROS [ 5]. However, few studies have \ncorrelated antioxidant potential with NSAID -associated injury of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDocument 6202: Mar. Drugs 2012 , 10 2626  \n \n demonstrating that PLSs from al gae inhibited ethanol -induced gastric damage by increasing tissue \nGSH levels through the inactivation of ROS and products of lipid peroxidation [12]. Previous research \nsuggested that ROS -induced damage can be prevented in two ways: by suppressing free -radical \ngeneration or by scavenging the free radicals generated [4 1]. Thus, we suggest that PLS prevents \nnaproxen -induced gastropathy by increasing GSH levels and that this effect may be secondary to a \ndecrease in free radical production. In addition, our resu lts demonstrated that the administration of PLS \nresults in a significant decrease in the concentration of MDA in naproxen -induced gastropathy. Thus, \nthe mechanism through which PLS exerts its gastroprotective effect appears to involve a reduction in \nthe li pid peroxidation induced by naproxen administration.  \nConcomitantly, our results showed that naproxen also decreases GSH levels and increases lipid \nperoxidation in the small intestine. Treatment with PLS did not inhibit the effects of naproxen on these \nbiochemical parameters in this organ. Thus, we suggest that the mechanisms  underlying the \ngastroprotective effect of PLS promote an increase in gastric mucosal resistance and a decrease in \naggressive factors. In contrast to the gastric tissue, the increase in endogenous GSH levels in the small \nintestine does not appear to contribute to this effect. A possible mechanism may involve the \ndownregulation of the inflammatory response by inhibiting the synthesis and release of  \npro-inflammatory mediators.  \n3. Experimen tal Section  \n3.1. Extraction of the Sulfated Polysaccharide Fraction  \nThe marine alga G. birdiae was collected from the Atlantic coast of Brazil (Flecheiras Beach, \nTrair\u00ed , Cear\u00e1 ). The samples were cleaned of epiphytes, washed with distilled water, and stored  at  \n\u221220 \u00b0 C. The polysaccharide extraction procedure was performed according to  the method described by \nFarias et al. [42]. The dried tissue (5 g) was milled  and suspended in 250 mL of 0.1 M sodium acetate \nbuffer (pH 6.0) containing 510 mg of papain (E. Merck),  5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM cysteine, and \nincubated at 60  \u00b0 C for 12 h. The residue was removed by filtration and centrifugation ( 2700 \u00d7 g for  \n25 min at 4  \u00b0 C), and the sulfated polysaccharides were precipitated by the addition of 48 mL of  10% \ncetylpyridinium  chlor ide (CPC, Sigma Chemical ). The mixture was centrifuged (2700 \u00d7 g for 25 min at \n4 \u00b0 C) and the polysaccharides ( kappa -carrageenan)  in the pellet were washed with 200 mL of 0.05% \ncetylpyridinium chloride solution, dissolved in 174 mL of a 2 M NaCl\/ethanol (100 :15, v\/v) solution, \nand precipitated with 200 mL of 70% ethanol ( v\/v) for 12 h at 4  \u00b0 C. Aft er further centrifugation (2700 \u00d7 g \nfor 25 min at 4  \u00b0 C), the precipitate was washed twice with 200 mL of absolute ethanol and dried with \nacetone under hot air flow (6 0 \u00b0 C). \n3.2. Chemical Characterization of the Sulfated Polysaccharide Fraction  \nThe chemical characterization was previously determined [11,20]. Total sugar content of each \nfraction was determined according to the method of Dubois [ 43]. Protein content was m easured by \nBradford\u2019s method [ 44]. Sulfate content in polysaccharides was determined by the barium \nchlorideegelatin method [ 45] and the monosaccharide composition of red seaweed galactans was \nobtained by reductive hydrolysis [ 46].\n\nDocument 76: Mar.

A detailed overview\non this issue is given by Nowak and Selmar ( 2016 ). In principle, the translocation\nof alkaloids from roots into the shoots could be performed by either xylem orphloem transport. In case of a xylem transport, translocation would be entrainedpassively by transpiration \ufb02ow, whereas a phloem-related translocation requires a\nsource -sink-allocation. The pattern of imported nicotine in the acceptor plants\nclearly showed that its concentration was highest in older leaves, i.e., the leaftissues that exhibit the greatest transpiration surface. In contrast, the smaller young\nleaves, representing physiological sinks, had far lower nicotine concentrations\n(Selmar et al. 2015a ,b). These coherences indicate that the entered nicotine is\ntranslocated via the xylem, driven by the transpiration \ufb02ow. These \ufb01ndings are\nsupported by Weidner et al. ( 2005 ), who determined nicotine in the xylem sap,\nwhen the alkaloid was fed to a hydroponic system of Epipremnum aureum .\nAnalogously to the xylem based nicotine translocation in acceptor plants, alsopyrrolizidine and purine alkaloids are relocated after their uptake. The occurrence ofthese alkaloids in guttation droplets of acceptor plants (Nowak 2017 ) as well as the\npattern of PA distribution (Nowak et al. 2016 ) indicates a xylem based transloca-\ntion, which fully is in accordance with the prediction of Trapp and Legind ( 2011 )\nbased on the log Dvalues of substances taken up by the acceptor plants.\nIn contrast, the translocation of alkaloids in genuine alkaloidal plants follows\nquite different prerequisites. Depending on the pattern of distribution, either aphloem associated or a xylem transport occurs: in Senecio vulgaris the PAs pro-\nduced in the roots are transported via phloem into the sink tissues such as \ufb02owers or\nseeds (Ehmke et al. 1988 ; Hartmann and Dierich 1989 ) whereas in Nicotina syl-\nvestris nicotine is translocated from the roots into the leaves via xylem (Baldwin\n1989 ). Details on this entire issue, especially the pH dependent changes in mem-\nbrane permeability, are given by Nowak and Selmar ( 2016 ). These coherences\npresented a sound explanation for the occurrence of PA- N-oxides in the phloem\n(Fig. 2), a\ufb01nding which was elaborated in the group of Hartmann several decades\nago (e.g., Ehmke et al. 1988 ; Lindigkeit et al. 1997 ).\nThe Horizontal Transfer of Other Classes of Natural\nProduct\nIt is understood that the coherences on the membrane permeability and log Pvalues\nmentioned above are valid for other classes of natural products, too. Accordingly,phenolic compounds, terpenoids and all other substances are also able to diffusethrough biomembranes as long the hydrophilic as well as the lipophilic properties ofHorizontal Natural Product Transfer: A so Far Unconsidered \u2026 219","topic":"Algae Biofuel Production"}}

The US daily consumption of gasoline was 384.7 million gallons in\n2015 (EIA 2016a ). To produce liquid fuels, biomass is the sole renewable feedstock.\nMore important, biomass is extensively available from well-established productionsystems, engendering the practicality of manufacturing renewable liquid biofuels.\nTremendous research has been carried out to develop ef\ufb01cient techniques for con-\nverting biomass into liquid fuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, pyrolysis bio-oil,and drop-in transportation fuels. Bioethanol and biodiesel have been increasingly\nproduced in many countries since 1980 to supplement the petro-gasoline and diesel\nsupply. For example, 6% of the global crop grains went to biofuel production in2014 (REA 2015 ); in the same year, 37% of the US corn grain was used to generate\n14.3 billion gallons of bioethanol (IAState 2015 ). The European Union (EU) has\nestablished the goal to meet 10% of its liquid transportation fuel demand with bio-fuels by 2020 (USDA 2015 ). As such, biofuels mostly refer to biomass-based liquid\nfuel products, though there are solid biofuels (e.g., \ufb01rewood) and gaseous biofuels\n(e.g., biomethane). This chapter adopts the narrow meaning of \u201cbiofuel.\u201d It reviewsthe development and production of various liquid biofuels from different biomass\nmaterials in the global scenario, helping envisage the future of biofuels. Perspectives\nof other solid and gaseous biofuels can be found in Guo et al. ( 2015 ).\n2 Development and Production of Bioethanol\nMost four-wheeled passenger automobiles are powered by a four-stroke, spark-\nignition internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline, a liquid (density\n~0.745 g cm\u22123at 15 \u00b0C) of C 4\u2013C 12hydrocarbon mixture (higher heating value\n46.5 kJ g\u22121) re\ufb01ned from petroleum by fractional distillation (1 barrel of crude oil\nyields 19 gallons of gasoline). Today, gasoline engine vehicles and gasoline supply\ninfrastructure are all over the world and become a critical component of the moderneconomy.\nThe supply of gasoline depends solely on the availability of petroleum, the so-\ncalled crude oil formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms under speci\ufb01cgeologic conditions (e.g., high temperature and high pressure) over millions of years\n(NGS 2013 ). Petroleum exists only in underground pockets of certain geographic\nlocations, and therefore, reliance on crude oil for gasoline poses threats to the energyindependence and security of many nations. The energy crisis in the 1970s dur-\ning which the USA, Western Europe, Japan, and other industrial countries suffered\nfrom extraordinarily high crude oil price and severe gasoline shortage, for example,\nwas caused by the petroleum export embargo from Organization of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) and the Islamic Revolution-induced social chaos inIran (a major crude oil exporting country) (Lifset 2014 ). Moreover, petroleum is\nnon-renewable; its limited reserve can only maintain the supply of crude oil at the\ncurrent trading \ufb02ow into the future 50 years (IEA 2013b ). In addition, extraction of\ncrude oil and consumption of gasoline have engendered enormous environmental\nimpacts such as water pollution, wildlife habitat destruction, and climate change.\n\nDocument 4713: 244 P. K. Rose\n9.5 Biofuel\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration report (EIA) i.e. IEO2019\n(International Energy outlook 2019), world energy consumption will rise by 50%between 2018 and 2050 (U.S. 2021 ). Aforesaid energy demand is very dif\ufb01cult\nto achieve from diminishing fossil fuel reserves. Further, issues such as depletion\nof fossil reserves, increasing prices, securities issue of supply, and environmentalpollution shift attention to sustainable alternatives. The second-generation feedstocks\nsuch as agricultural residue, forest waste, etc., are non-edible, available in ample\nquantity, environment friendly, and high in holocellulosic content can be a sustainablechoice for their bioconversion into various biofuels such as bioethanol, biobutanol\n(Kushwaha et al. 2019 ).\n9.5.1 Bioethanol\nThe production of bioethanol via sugarcane fermentation is practices since 6000 BCE\n(Before Common Era). Corn feedstock-based ethanol replaced whale oil (as lamp oil)\naround the 1800 century (Sticklen 2007 ). It was the year 1970 when global oil crises\nshift the focus on the development of alternatives of petroleum products and thatupturned the ethanol market (Demirbas 2010 ). In 2005, the United States incorporate\nthe \u201c Renewable Fuels Standard \u201d in their policy aim to touch the production of ethanol\nfrom 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 36 billion gallons yearly by 2022 (Bagheri et al.2016 ; Halder et al. 2019 ). In 2016, the United States generated about 57,700 million\nliters of ethanol from corn (\ufb01rst generation feedstock) and Brazil generates about\n27,600 million liters of ethanol from sugarcane (Mohanty and Swain 2019 ). The\nworldwide bioethanol production in 2018 was 110 billion liters and anticipate to touch\nthe 140 billion liters mark in 2022 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of\n7.6% (Sharma et al. 2020 ; Edeh 2020 ). The corn stover-based advanced bioethanol\nplants cost up to US$ 1.82 to 2.5\/litre\/year of production capacity (Humbird et al.\n2011 ) and capital cost breakdown is shown in Fig. 9.6. Bioethanol has the largest\nmarket in the fuel sector due to its potential as a primary fuel or gasoline additive\n(Dutt 2016 )( s e eF i g . 9.5).\nThe bioconversion routes of bioethanol production primarily depend on the source\nof feedstock, and the ef\ufb01ciency of bioconversion steps i.e. pre-treatment, sacchari\ufb01-\ncation, fermentation, and recovery process. The pre-treatment ensures holocellulose\navailability for the sacchari\ufb01cation process by shattering the recalcitrant lignocellu-losic structure and share 30% cost per gallon of ethanol (Edeh 2020 ). This makes\npre-treatment the costliest step in lignocellulose biomass-based bioethanol produc-\ntion.

If this funicular form is stiffened and \ninverted, it will turn out to be the best form for an arch to \nsupport the same set of loads: \u201cAs hangs the flexible line, so \nbut inverted will stand the rigid arch\u201d (Fig.\u00a0 21). He high -\nlighted the relationship between the self-formed catenary \ncurve of a hanging chain working in tension only, and the \nideal shape of an arch with the same span, rise, and set of \nloads, to work in compression only, avoiding in both cases \nbending.\nFrei Otto built in 1952 a \u201cstanding chain\u201d or \u201cmulti-  \nhinged arch,\u201d an arch model able to take different lines of \nthrust or arch outlines with varying patterns of loads. Its \nvoussoirs had convex contacting faces, and could roll over \neach other, and were also secured against slipping by threads. \nFig. 19  (a, left) Hanging chain of constant length with supports separating gradually.

Moreover, oligo-fucoidan boosts the immune system, enhances anti-viral-associated gene expression, and declines lipogenic enzymes and liver fibrosis-related genes.","reference_context":"Document 5714: dot represents one \ufb01sh.

Oligo-Fucoidan Enhances the Viability of Normal Hepatocytes\nClone 9, a rat normal hepatocyte line, was treated with oligo-fucoidan to examine whether\noligo-fucoidan o \ufb00ers a cytoprotective e \ufb00ect. Intriguingly, we found that oligo-fucoidan signi\ufb01cantly\nincreased the viability of normal liver cells (Figure 5A). Healthy hepatocytes contain abundant Cyp3a4,\nwhich is a critical enzyme for oxidizing toxins and drugs mainly in the liver and intestines, whose activity\ndisplays a decreasing trend with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression [ 36,37]. We found\nthat oligo-fucoidan treatment enhanced the Cyp3a4 activity in Clone 9 cells (Figure 5B). We further\ninvestigated the upstream regulator of Cyp3a4, the Hnf4a , which is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor\nthat is associated with improved liver function: a previous study demonstrated that Hnf4a expression\nis decreased in hepatic cirrhosis, but the overexpression of Hnf4a resets the transcription factor network\nin hepatocytes and prevents hepatic failure [ 38]. We found that oligo-fucoidan signi\ufb01cantly upregulated\nthe expression of Hnf4a in Clone 9 cells (Figure 5C).\n\nDocument 1405: of the liver cell transcriptomes [ 48]. Therefore, we revealed that oligo-fucoidan enhancements to the\nimmune system might bene\ufb01t from the changing of Kup \ufb00er cells and monocyte-derived macrophages\nin the liver.\nThe hepatocyte-protective e \ufb00ect of oligo-fucoidan is an interesting \ufb01nding in this study.\nOligo-fucoidan is considered as a food supplement without potential toxicity. In our experiment,\nwe have used oligo-fucoidan to feed zebra\ufb01sh, and we have provided evidence that oligo-fucoidan not\nonly boosts the immune system and enhance anti-viral-associated gene expression but also declines\nlipogenic enzymes and liver \ufb01brosis-related genes. In fact, brown seaweeds containing fucoidan\nare widely consumed as part of a normal diet in East Asia, particularly in Japan, Korea, Taiwan,\nand mainland China. However, liver cancer incidence is relatively higher in these countries \/regions,\n\nDocument 3468: Biomolecules 2020 ,10, 898 16 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nUsing transcriptomic analysis of the liver from wild-type zebra\ufb01sh after feeding oligo-fucoidan,\nwe found that genes involved in immune system development were upregulated, especially in that\nwe veri\ufb01ed the expression of anti-viral, anti-microbial, and immune modulation proteins by qPCR.\nOur data suggest that oligo-fucoidan might enhance the anti-viral ability and increase the immunity\nagainst virus infection. We also found that genes involved in lipid metabolism, \ufb01brosis, and liver cancer\nwere downregulated, and especially we veri\ufb01ed the expression of fasn,scd,loxl2a ,foxo3b, and soat1 by\nqPCR. We have proven that oligo-fucoidan binds to the ASGPR1 \/2 receptors on hepatocytes, and this is\nthe \ufb01rst report to identify the potential receptor for oligo-fucoidan. We also provide strong evidence\nthat the signal transduction cascade is activated after oligo-fucoidan binds to the ASGPR1 \/2 receptors,\nsuch as a STAT3-mediated signaling cascade. Our study provides insight into oligo-fucoidan through\nactivation of the ASGPR1 \/2\/STAT3 \/P1-HNF4A axis, which results in resetting the genetic regulatory\nnetworks of hepatocytes and enhancing the overall healthy physiological status of the cells.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.-H.Y.; methodology, W.-W.Y., C.-C.C., and K.-H.L.; validation,\nW.-W.Y., C.-C.C., and K.-H.L.; investigation, C.-H.Y.; resources, M.-C.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nC.H.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.-W.L. and C.-H.Y.; supervision, C.-H.Y.; project administration, C.-H.Y.;\nfunding acquisition, C.-H.Y.

Actually, fucoidan and evening primrose\nextract inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori  to gastric cells\nand their colonization there [29,30,32], which is a well-known action mechanism of proton-pump inhibitors that\nsuppress H. pylori  growth [43-45].\nNotably, FEMY-R7 treatment decreased the blood\nlevels of pepsinogens I and II. Since a part (approximately\n1%) of the pepsinogens secreted from the stomach walls\nare released into blood, the levels of pepsinogens I andII and their ratio have been used as a surrogate marker\nof gastric secretory function [46-48]. Especially, the\nblood pepsinogen II level was proposed to be a potentialmarker of morphological change of the stomach during\nH. pylori -induced gastritis and tumor development [39].\nIndeed, in previous studies [38,40], successful eradicationtherapy of H. pylori  resulted in a decrease in the serum\nlevel of pepsinogen II, and ensuing an increase in the\npepsinogen I\/II ratio. In the present study, both the bloodpepsinogens I and II decreased and the ratio of pepsinogen\nI\/II increased following treatment with FEMY-R7,\nindicating that it improved the inflammatory response byeliminating H. pylori  from the gastric mucosa.\nEffective therapy of H. pylori  has been provided with\ntriple therapies (for example, omeprazole+clarithromycin\n+amoxicillin or omeprazole+clarithromycin+metronidazole)\nconsisting of two antibiotics [2]. However, it has beenwell demonstrated that the widespread use of antibiotics\nled to a rapidly-increasing bacterial resistance [24,43].\nThus, there is a strong rationale for the development ofnovel anti-bacterial agents without resistance and adverse-\neffects. In the present study, it was found that FEMY-R7\nnot only eliminated H. pylori  from the stomach walls of\nmice and humans, but also did not alter the hematological\nand blood biochemical parameters, related to tissueinjuries, of human patients. Taken together, it is suggested\nthat FEMY-R7, a combinational regimen composed of\nfucoidan and evening primrose extract, could be apromising candidate overcoming tolerance of antibiotics\nfor the treatment of recurrent H. pylori  infection.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the fund of Misuba RTech\nCo.

Drugs 2018 ,16, 454 6 of 14\nDU-145 cells were treated with LMWF alone or in combination with GroA (Supplement Figure S7).\nFollowing GroA treatment, the distribution of the apoptotic cells showed that the percentage of viable\ncells decreased by about 30%, whereas the percentage of early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells\nincreased by 23% and 5%, respectively . The cell population of DU-145 treated with different concentrations\nof LMWF (100, 200 and 300 \u00b5g\/mL) resulted in the reduction of cell viability (from 97.08 to 77.76%,\n68.32% and 51.43%), compared to the control. In addition, the percentages of both early and late\napoptotic cells were increased with the increasing concentration of LMWF in the combination group.\nTreatment with GroA alone compared to the combined treatment with LMWF has shown an increase in\nboth early and late apoptotic population (combined early and late apoptotic cells increased from 28 to 31%,\n50% and 58%), and the percentage of viable cells was reduced with increased concentrations of LMWF.\nTherefore, treatment with a combination of LMWF with GroA caused a significant change in the cell\nviability and increased apoptosis in the treated DU-145 cells.\nThe apoptotic cell death observed in treated PC-3 cells was similar to that of DU-145 cells after 72 h\n(Supplement Figure S8). GroA increased the apoptotic cell death of PC-3 cells compared to control (Cro).\nLMWF in increasing concentrations (100, 200, and 300 \u00b5g\/mL) has also elevated the apoptotic cell\ndeath. The total apoptotic percentage increased with the increasing concentration of LMWF, and LMWF\ninduced cellular apoptosis increased 20% compared with Cro alone. Moreover, compared to GroA-alone\ntreated cells, the combined treatment of LMWF (300 \u00b5g\/mL) with GroA raised the apoptotic cell death,\nwith apoptotic cells\u2019 percentage 35% higher than cells treated with GroA alone. Other groups of combined\ntreatments of GroA with different LMWF concentrations also showed remarkable changes, but the\ncombination of 300 \u00b5g\/mL LMWF with GroA was the most effective in increasing apoptotic cell death.\nTherefore, treatments with LMWF (100, 200, and 300 \u00b5g\/mL) resulted in an approximate 20% of cell\ndeath of PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Nevertheless, the apoptotic cell death was robust when the cells were\ntreated with the combination of LMWF (100, 200, and 300 \u00b5g\/mL) and GroA, compared to each drug\nalone in both cell lines. Thus, the results strongly suggest that the combined treatment of LMWF and\nGroA can inhibit cell viability , while enhancing apoptotic cell death.\nIn the combined treatment of FS with GroA, it was found that the distribution of the PC-3 and\nDU-145 cellular apoptosis characters was only changed by GroA treatment. When cells were treated\nwith FS (500, 750 and 1000 \u00b5g\/mL) combined with Cro (10 \u00b5M), there was no signi\ufb01cant effect on cell\ndeath compared to Cro-alone treated cells. Furthermore, both GroA and the combination of GroA with\nFS had lower apoptosis level compared with FS alone, however, there was no statistical signi\ufb01cance\nbetween GroA and the combination of GroA with FS treatments. Thus, FS alone or in combination\nwith GroA did not induce PC-3 or DU-145 cell apoptosis (data not shown, further experiments only\ncontinued working with LMWF due to its effectiveness).\nThe results demonstrate that the combined effect of LMWF and GroA on DU-145 and PC-3\ncell viability and cell death is signi\ufb01cantly more effective compared to each of the treatments alone.\nHowever, in the results of GroA combined with FS, the combination effect of the two drugs was not\nimproved synergistically. In all the FS concentrations that were tested, it did not increase the inhibitory\neffect of GroA. There were no signi\ufb01cant differences between the cell viability values when cells were\ntreated with 10 \u00b5M GroA with or without FS (500, 750 and 1000 \u00b5g\/mL).

Fluorescence of each well was measured at the\noptimal excitation wavelength of 499 nm with the emission maximum at a wavelength of 521 nm.\n3.6. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,\nUSA) software package. Results were expressed as mean \u00b1SEM (sample n = 3 with triplicate analysis\ndone on each sample). Analyses of variance were performed using one-way ANOVA, with post hoc\nTuckey\u2019s test for significant differences. A nominal two-sided p< 0.05 was used to assess significance.\n4. Conclusions\nThe present study describes the effect of LMWF, FS, or combinations of either drug with GroA,\non cell proliferation and cell death of human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. It was shown\nthat LMWF inhibited the growth and viability of the cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.\nCombination of LMWF and GroA had a synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth and viability of the\nprostate cancer cells, hence we consider it as a potential candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.\nOn the other hand, the effect of FS was not signi\ufb01cant at the concentrations and combinations tested.\nIn the combined treatment of FS and GroA, FS was not able to enhance the inhibitory effect of GroA on\ncell proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells, even at very high concentrations.\nWe found that even at low doses, LMWF signi\ufb01cantly improved the anti-proliferative effect of\nGroA. Furthermore, the combination of LMWF and GroA not only induces cell growth inhibition,\nbut it also enhanced cell death induced by each of the drugs alone and by the combined treatment.\nMoreover, at least part of the cell death induced is a caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.\nIn summary, this study shows that LMWF can synergistically increase GroA\u2019s anti-cancer effect\nin the tested cell lines, and together they induce a stronger inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth and\ntumorogenicity. This indicates that LMWF has the potential to be developed into a supplement therapy\nfor prostate cancer.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/16\/11\/454\/\ns1.\nAuthor Contributions: X.Y., S.S.T., J.L.

The complex amino acid and carbohydrate patterns\nof the algal cell wall determine its shape and integrity and exhibit functions such as\nsignaling, defense, cell recognition, expansion and differentiation.\nMicroalgal cell wall has the ability to alter their cell wall composition with\nenvironmental condition (Fig. 1). This property is more prevalent in symbiotic\nalgae which make it dif\ufb01cult to study their cell wall. Free-living algal cells have\nsigni\ufb01cantly thicker cell walls, increased storage reserves and modi\ufb01ed chloroplast\nstructure as compared to symbiotic algae (Sanders et al. 2005 ).\nFluorescent stains and dyes have been helpful in distinguishing different algal\ngroups wherein the sugar composition of cell wall has been used as a means of algal\nclassi\ufb01cation. However, many algal groups (e.g. Chlorella spp., Scenedesmus spp.,\nHaematococcus spp.) respond unusually to stains and dyes that make the study of\ncell wall pro\ufb01ling dif\ufb01cult. The inability of \ufb02uorescent dyes and stains to penetrate\nthe microalgal cell wall resulting in unusual staining is due to the characteristic cell\nwall structure and composition of algae. The action of \ufb02uorescein diacetate (FDA),\na vital stain, was reversed in algal cells wherein >90% of the dead cells were\nstained and the viable cells were impenetrable by FDA stain. Another dye,\npropidium iodide which is an indicator of cell death is reported to give the same\nred \ufb02uorescence in dead cells as is emitted by the auto\ufb02uorescing healthy cells of\nalgae rendering it to be non-functional as well. The culture environment also affects\nalgal cell wall structure and cellular metabolism and hence affects the staining of\nmany microalgae. Cell wall staining in Coelastrum cambricum with calco\ufb02uor-\nwhite was dependant on cell age whereas in Scenedesmus acuminatus,\nSynechocystis sp. and Anabaena sp. it was non-functional with the exception to\nbroken, dividing or dead cells.

The problems associated with\nenzymes for cell wall degradation are that they exhibit strong strain and growth\nFig. 1 Generalized\ntrilaminar structure of algal\ncell wallAlgal Biomass Pretreatment for Improved Biofuel Production 261\n\nDocument 5791: 1 Introduction\nAlgal biomass contributes signi\ufb01cantly in the biomass based renewable energy\ngeneration. Algae are photosynthetic aquatic microorganism, which utilize CO 2\nfor synthesis of biomass and other metabolites. Algae have ability to utilizenutrients from range of wastewaters and CO\n2from the various gaseous streams\nincluding industrial \ufb02ue gas (Prajapati et al. 2013 ). Simultaneous biomass produc-\ntion and wastewater treatment further improve the potential of algal biomass asfeedstock for biofuel production (Chinnasamy et al. 2010 ; Choudhary et al. 2016 ;\nPrajapati et al. 2016 ). Major biofuels produced using algal biomass include:\nbiodiesel, bioethanol, biooil, biohydrogen and methane (Prajapati and Malik\n2015 ). However, irrespective of the biofuel production route, the recalcitrant nature\nof the algal cell wall is the major hurdle. The recalcitrant nature of the algae is dueto the presence of complex biopolymers such as micro\ufb01brillar polysaccharides,matrix polysaccharides and proteoglycans. Hence, pretreatment of the algal bio-mass usually becomes necessary to improve the biofuel extraction. Pretreatment ofalgal cells deals with extraction process and yield of biomass\/biofuel. This phaseincludes the cell wall disruption mediated by physical (mechanical), chemical and\nenzymatic methods.\nIn the light of the above discussion, the present chapter is focused upon various\naspects of algal cell wall and its role in decreasing the biofuel yield. Subsequently,various pretreatment technologies utilized for improving the biofuel yield aredescribed. Some of the pretreatment methods such as enzymatic lysis, homogeni-zation, milling, ultrasonication, osmotic pressure shock and pretreatment of algalcells mediated solvent extraction method are presented in this chapter. Moreover,the quanti\ufb01cation of the pretreatment effects is crucial in order to identify the best\npossible pretreatment methods and also for the optimization of a particular method.\nHence, qualitative and quantitative analysis of algal biomass pretreatment is alsoincluded. Finally, some recent report on algal biomass pretreatment resulting inimproved biofuel yield is discussed to cover the current and future prospects of thealgal based biofuels.\n2 The Algal Cell Wall\nThe cell walls of algae are composed of different \ufb01brillar, matrix and crystallinepolymers, proteins and other compounds. The carbohydrate fraction of cell wall\nprimarily consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and glycoproteins along with limited\nquantity of rhamnose, fucose, mannose and glucose. The generalized structure ofalgal cell wall consists of the plasma membrane over which a cell wall consisting ofcelluloses and glycans is present. However, in some algae an additional \u2018encrusting\nlayer \u2019is present which constitutes of signi\ufb01cant amount of silica, calcium carbonate\nor a resistant biopolymer called as \u2018algaenan \u2019. The protein content of the algal cell260 V. Mishra et al.\n\nDocument 1813: structure is lost due to metabolic disorders leading to biosynthesis of unusual sugars\n(Burczyk et al. 1995 ).\n3 Effect of Algal Cell Wall on Biofuel Production\nAlgal cell wall poses a noteworthy barrier to lipid and other metabolite extraction\nfrom most algal species (Razon and Tan 2011 ). Developments in the \ufb01eld of algal\nbiofuels have largely been restricted due to the rigid cell wall structure. The majorcontributors to the resistive nature of the algal cell wall are presence of algaenanand other complex carbohydrates. The carbohydrate polymers in the algal cell wall\nare mainly composed of cellulose, xylose, glucose fructose and mannose. Algal\nbiomass has been vastly studied and projected as the most viable alternative againstfossil fuels. However, for this to succeed, signi\ufb01cant advancement in geneticmanipulation for optimum production and processing of biomass, lipid extractionand downstream processing is essentially required. To this, biofuel production isrestricted owing to the complex cell wall characteristics of microalgae. Algal cellwall restricts biofuel production as the elevated content of cell wall polysaccharidein algal cells signi\ufb01cantly complicates the process for extraction of lipids and algal\nmetabolites. The complex nature of cell wall interferes with the pretreatment of\nalgal biomass towards improving biofuel yield. In pretreatment step, the algal cellwall is disrupted to increase the availability of bioactive compounds to be convertedto biofuels (Harun et al. 2014 ; Huang et al. 2014 ). Thus ef\ufb01cient pretreatment is\nhighly desirable for increasing biofuel yield which is adversely affected by the rigidalgal cell wall (Wiltshire et al. 2000 ).\n4 Pretreatment Methods for Algal Biomass\n4.1 Physical Methods\nPhysical pretreatment of algal cells is usually performed to disrupt the cell wall and\nto improve the effectiveness of the lipid extraction process by increasing the contactof solvent with the intracellular lipid content.

Thepowder metallurgy\npreparation resulted intheformation ofglobular, soft-edged\ngrains duetotheconsolidation ofsmall metallic particles\n(Figure 1b).Globular zincparticles inasizeranging from1to\n10\u03bcmandrather irregular Fe-based clusters werefound inthe\nmaterial microstructure (Figure 1c).Since thelowsintering\ntemperature waschosen (330 \u00b0C),nointermetallic phases\noccurred inthematerial; however, zincdiffusion intotheiron\nparticles isanticipated.\nAFMwasusedtostudythesurface morphology ofsintered\nsamples atthenanoscale level(Figure 1d).Theaverage\nroughness valuewasobtained fromtheAFMmeasurements to\nillustrate thetexture\/topography ofamaterial.

Natural sources can be suc-cessfully utilized in some branches of bio-based industry. Over the years, algae have already found application in many fields of life, among which the most important seem to be medicine, pharmacology, and the cosmetic industry. Algae extracts are an inestimable and, more importantly, renewable source of hundreds of chemical compounds that offer a wide spectrum of desired physiological activities.\nReferences\nAgatonovic-Kustrin S, Morton DW (2018) Quantification of poly-\nphenolic antioxidants and free radical scavengers in marine algae. \nJ\u00a0Appl Phycol 30:113\u2013120\nAgatonovic-Kustrin S, Morton DW, Ristivojevi\u0107 P (2016) Assessment \nof antioxidant activity in Victorian marine algal extracts using high performance thin-layer chromatography and multivariate analysis.

{"id":"510ca771-422e-47ad-a7a7-4ef37f3977b5","question":"Can you explain the impact of fucoidan on obesity-related inflammation and how it influences the progression of obesity-related metabolic diseases?","reference_answer":"Fucoidan, a highly sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweed, has been found to possess anti-obesity effects. It decreases body fat accumulation and inhibits inflammation in obese murine adipose tissue. Fucoidan also inhibits obesity-associated high blood pressure, which suggests it may be used as a new anti-obesity agent.","reference_context":"Document 2271: devastating diseases. The anti-inflammation effects of\nfucoidan have been reported in several cell types. For\nexample,  fucoidan  inhibits  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-\ninduced  inflammation  in  macrophages[25] and\nmicroglial cells[26]. Our results indicated that fucoidan\nameliorated  inflammation  in  both  adipocytes  and\nmacrophages insulted by PA. Macrophages in adipose\ntissues can affect insulin signaling in adipocytes via a\nparacrine  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  obesity,\npromoting  the  progression  of  IR  and  obesity-related\nmetabolic diseases[27\u201328]. Adipocyte hypertrophy causes\nlocal  hypoxia,  which  drives  the  inflammatory\nresponses  in  both  macrophages  and  adipocytes.\nMeantime,  innate  immune  signaling  in  adipocytes  is\nactivated  by  FFA  or  other  cytokines.  This  processtriggers  the  infiltration  of  inflammatory  cells[29\u2013 32].\nPreadipocytes in obese adipose fat have increased pro-\ninflammatory  cytokines[33],  indicating  the  role  of\nadipocytes in the obesity-induced inflammation. Thus,\nthe  suppressing  effect  of  fucoidan  on  inflammatory\nresponses  in  both  macrophages  and  adipocytes\nprovides  an  aggravating  beneficial  effect  against\nobesity.  Petrus et  al have  been  reported  that  reduced\nglycolytic  rates  could  inhibit  pro-inflammatory  gene\nexpression  in  adipocytes[34].

The rapid prevalence of obesity\nis closely related to a variety of related diseases. Thus,\ndeveloping  noninvasive  anti-obesity  drugs  to  treat  or\nprevent  obesity  and  its  complications  would  be  of\nhigh  clinical  benefit.  In  the  present  study,  we\ndemonstrated  that  the  administration  of  fucoidan\ndecreased  the  HFD-induced  body  fat  accumulation\nand  inhibited  inflammation  in  obese  murine  adipose\ntissue.  Our  results  indicate  that  fucoidan  may  be\neffective to fight against obesity.\nFucoidan,  a  highly  sulfated  polysaccharide\nextracted  from  brown  seaweed,  has  been  found  to\npossess  antioxidant,  anti-tumogenestic,  and  immuno-\nregulatory  properties[17\u2013 19].  Recently,  an  anti-obesity\neffect of fucoidan has been reported in HFD-induced\nmice  as  evidenced  by  the  inhibition  of  fataccumulation in adipocytes and blood[10\u201311,20]. Besides\nconfirming  this  bioactivity,  we  revealed  a  redistri-\nbution of fat in adipose tissues and increased oxygen\nconsumption in fucoidan-treated HFD mice. Moreover,\nwe  further  showed  that  fucoidan  treatment  could\nsuppress ectopic fat deposition in the liver. However,\nwhether fucoidan has an impact on lipid absorption is\nnot  yet  known.  The  potential  effect  of  fucoidan  on\nmultiple targets warrants further investigation.\nAdipose  tissue  has  been  considered  as  important\nsites for inflammation in obesity[4,21]. The pathogenesis\nprocess of many obesity-related metabolic dysfunction,\nincluding  IR,  steatohepatitis,  and  cardiovascular\ndiseases, are orchestrated by chronic low level inflam-\nmation[22\u2013 24].

The expression of M2 marker genes, \nCD206, Arg-1, and IL-10, increased significantly \nin the liver, while levels of M1 markers TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and iNOS decreased, indicating that \nadministering fucoidan increased the polarization of liver M2\/M1 cells, and thereby reduced the inflammatory infiltration of epididymal adipose tissue.\n44\nReducing macrophage inflammation. At the end \nof the 20th century, the famous pathologist Ross first put forward the \u2018inflammation theory\u2019 of ath-erosclerosis, which provided new ideas for the treatment of the condition. Studies have shown that fucoidan can reduce the inflammatory cyto-kines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1b, and iNOS released by mac-rophages and significantly reduce the adhesion of the Ox-LDL coating to the surface of macro-phages,\n75 thus reducing the transformation of \nmacrophages into foam cells. Fucoidan from brown algae enhanced p62\/SQSTM1-dependent selective autophagy by targeting macrophages, promoting the co-localization of NLRP3 and p62, inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflam-matory bodies, and thus reducing inflammation and slowing the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.\n76 A mechanistic study has shown that \nfucoidan isolated from Saccharomyces japonicum can significantly inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1  induced, by lipopolysaccharides \nand effectively inhibit inflammation by blocking NF-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and JAK-STAT pathways.\n77\nOther effects on macrophages. Under the action \nof scavenger receptor A and type B family member CD36, which are expressed on the surface of mac-rophages, macrophages excessively phagocytose the modified lipid Ox-LDL, which accumulates near the endothelium, and serious accumulation of lipids in the cells is promoted by negative feed-back regulation of the related receptors. Finally, the cells gradually become foamy and turn into foam cells that gradually accumulate to form the initial marker of atherosclerosis\u2014early lipid stripes.\n78 Fucoidan has been found to significantly inhibit Ox-LDL uptake by macrophages at a range of concentrations (1-100 mg\/ml), thus reducing \nthe possibility of macrophages transforming into foam cells.\n79 In addition, fucoidan attenuates the \nmigration of THP-1-derived macrophages and the production of pro-inflammatory factors by regu-lating the production of colony-stimulating factor 1, slowing the development of atherosclerosis.\n80\nPromoting autophagy of foam cells. During the \nformation of atherosclerotic plaques, monocytes enter the sub-endothelium of the vascular wall and transform into macrophages. Modified lipo-proteins increase the risk of cholesterol accumu-lation in monocyte-derived macrophages.\n81 A \nlarge number of lipid droplets also gathers in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which determines the possibility of their conversion into foam cells. It has been reported that macrophages are the main source of foam cell formation, but SMCs can produce foam cells during the late and early pathological stages in humans. Stem\/progenitor cells and endothelial cells can also form foam cells.\n81 Foam cells are a sign of early pathological \nchanges in AS; therefore, they also present impor-tant targets for the treatment of AS.\nAutophagy, a cell and tissue self-renewal process, \ncan degrade the lipids in foam cells and is particu-larly critical in foam cell formation. Fucoidan can enhance the autophagy-lysosome system of foam cells, increase cell autophagy to degrade lipids, and thus play a role in anti-atherosclerosis defenses.\n82 The fusion of autophagosomes and\n\nDocument 4331: inflammatory adipokines, exacerbating obesity-related\nmetabolic  dysfunction.  However,  increased  adi-\npogenesis  in  the  adipose  tissue  is  accompanied  by\nreduction in pro-inflammatory adipokines[36]. Further-\nmore,  large  fat  cells  are  under  hypoxic  stress,  which\naugments  inflammatory  cell  infiltration.  The  smaller\nfat  cells  produced  in  adipogenesis  can  decrease  the\ninflammation  in  adipose  tissues[37].  In  our  study,  the\ndecrease  in  fat  mass  was  accompanied  by  shrinking\ndiameter  of  the  adipocyte  and  inhibition  of  anti-\nadipogenesis effects in fucoidan-treated HFD mice. In\nconclusion,  pro-adipogenesis  may  be  a  possible\nmechanism  for  fucoidan  to  prevent  obesity  and\nobesity-related  metabolic  dysfunction,  but  more\nexperiments are needed to prove it.\nIn this study, we show that fucoidan inhibits murine\nbody  fat  accumulation  and  adipose  inflammation\ninduced  by  HFD.  Combined  with  our  previous\ndiscovery  that  fucoidan  inhibits  obesity-associated\nhigh  blood  pressure[12],  fucoidan  may  be  used  as  an\nnew anti-obesity agent. Certainly, more studies on its\nefficacy in human beings are needed in the future. \nAcknowledgments\nThis  work  was  supported  by  the  grants  from  theNational  Natural  Science  Foundation  of  China\n(81830011,  81670418,  and  91739304  to  Q.C.,\n81770417 to X.Z., 81870371 to J.B., and 81670263 to\nX.L.);  and  the  Natural  Science  Foundation  of  the\nJiangsu  Higher  Education  Institutions  of  China\n(18KJA310003 to J.B. and 15KJA310001 to X.L.).\nReferences\nWang YC, McPherson K, Marsh T, et al.

Their use improves the effects of metal nanoparticles for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer. They can induce both early and late apoptosis depending on concentration. They can also serve as contrasting agents for in vitro photoacoustic imaging of cancers like breast cancer. Moreover, many human tumors express P-selectin which might be considered a diagnostic marker and a target for drug delivery to tumor sites, including metastases. Fucoidan-based biovectors with P-selectin affinity have been used to target tumor cells.","reference_context":"Document 2362: Mar. Drugs 2019 ,17, 458 8 of 20\nAs shown in Table 2, various nanoparticles were tested to determine fucoidan potential in\nanticancer drug delivery. As model antitumor drugs, doxorubicin (DOX), copper sul\ufb01de (CuS),\nmethotrexate (MTX), curcumin (CUR), silver nitrate (AgNO 3), and cisplatin (CSN) were studied.\nIn 2013, Lee et al. developed self-organized nanoparticles with acetylated fucoidan from Fucus\nvesiculosus . DOX was introduced into the nanoparticles through dialysis and it was released according\nto the \ufb01rst order kinetics. Fucoidan was tested as a drug carrier due to its immunomodulatory\nproperties, ability to produce anticancer cytokines and drug e \ufb04ux pump inhibition [ 51]. In turn, Lu et\nal. created nanoparticles by applying electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged fucoidan\nand the cationic peptide\u2013protamine. The self-assembled complex was stable at pH 7.4 (corresponding\nto blood pH). When pH decreased to 4.5 (tumor cell pH) or 1.5 (stomach pH), electrostatic interactions\nbecame weaker, which led to increased diameter of nanoparticles and release of more than 90% of\nanticancer agent. The release of a smaller amount of DOX in the blood prevents side e \ufb00ects and\nincreases its concentration in tumor cells. This pH-dependent release pro\ufb01le makes intravenous\ninjection the best route for administration of these nanoparticles. Furthermore, using fucoidan that\npossesses the ability to interact with P-selectin present in the breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231),\nresulted in the improved cell internalization and better inhibitory e \ufb00ect of designed nanoparticles\nthan free DOX [ 52]. The polyelectrolyte complexing method (PEC) was used to combine fucoidan\nwith polyethyleneimine (PEI). Similarly to the previously described study, when the medium pH was\ndecreased, the increased release rate of DOX was noted. In vivo studies were performed using BALB \/c\nmice with induced breast tumor. The results demonstrated that intravenously injected nanoparticles\nwith DOX were characterized by stronger antiproliferative properties and higher tumor inhibitory\nactivity than free DOX. The bene\ufb01cial e \ufb00ects on the antitumor activity of the obtained nanoparticles\nwere caused probably by immunomodulatory properties of fucoidan, which were con\ufb01rmed in the\nin vitro studies [ 53]. In addition, fucoidan is characterized by the ability to improve the stability\nof metallic nanoparticles thereby contributing to the reduction of their toxicity. Fucoidan-coated\ngold nanoparticles with DOX caused a signi\ufb01cant decrease in rabbit squamous carcinoma cells (VX2)\nviability. The most signi\ufb01cant decrease in viability of the examined cells was observed after using both\nthe discussed nanoparticles and laser irradiation. Similar conclusions were drawn from the in vivo\nstudies conducted in rabbits with eye tumor. Only in the group treated with nanoparticles and laser,\ncomplete eradication of the tumor was observed after 6 days, and most importantly, there was no\nrelapse after 14 days [ 42]. In turn, Jang et al. used the layer-by-layer technique for the synthesis of CuS\nnanoparticles alternately coated with fucoidan and polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH). Based on\nthe obtained results, it was found that the applied nanoparticles showed stronger anticancer e \ufb00ect\nthan their components used separately. Obtained nanoparticles not only improved the intracellular\ntransport of fucoidan, which possesses the ability to induce apoptosis, but it also provided favorable\nphotothermal features. This was con\ufb01rmed in the in vitro studies using human cervical cancer cells\n(HeLa) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549), and in the in vivo studies in mice injected with\nthese cells [ 54]. The same ingredients (fucoidan and PAH) were used to create nanoparticles with\nMTX via self-assembly method. MTX was released according to the \ufb01rst order kinetics and it showed\nstronger in vitro inhibition of HeLa and MCF-7 cell proliferation than unbounded drug. It should be\n\nDocument 2596: Polymers 2023 ,15, 3242 14 of 25\nKim et al. developed fucoidan-coated gold nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin\nfor photothermal therapy of squamous carcinoma [ 148].In vitro cytotoxic assay was\nconducted on RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and on VX2 squamous cell line. As expected, as\nthe concentration of the nanoparticles increased, cell viability decreased. Furthermore, after\nlaser irradiation of the VX2 cells containing fucoidan-coated gold nanoparticles, maximal\ncell death was recorded (88%).\nFucoidan nanoparticles have also been used as carriers for cisplatin [ 151]. The prepared\nnanoparticles showed a high encapsulation ef\ufb01cacy of 93.3%, an average size of 181.2 nm\nand a zeta potential of \u221267.4 mV . An immune protection assay was performed on RAW\n264.7 macrophage cells to investigate the cytotoxic effect of encapsulated cisplatin. HCT-8\ntumor cells were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin, fucoidan and cisplatin-\nloaded fucoidan nanoparticles. The formulated nanoparticles caused greater toxicity to the\ntested cancer cells compared to the free drug.\nUsing the polyelectrolyte complexation method, Lue et al. developed multi-stimuli-\nresponsive fucoidan\/protamine nanoparticles as carriers for doxorubicin [ 178]. According\nto TEM and DLS analyses, the average particle size was 180 nm and the zeta potential\nranged from\u221222 mV to\u221243 mV depending on the fucoidan\/protamine ratio. The cytotoxic\neffect of the nanoparticles was evaluated using MDA-MB-231 cell line. Enzymatic digestion\nand the acidic intracellular microenvironment of the cancer cell triggered the release of dox-\norubicin from the nanoparticles, resulting in decreased cell viability. P-selectin expression\nwas determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-selectin\/CD62P) against MDA-\nMB-231 cells and the result showed that doxorubicin-loaded fucoidan\/protamine nanopar-\nticles inhibited platelet activation. The authors suggested that the proposed nanostructures\ncan be used as potential drug delivery systems for intracellular release of anticancer drugs\nagainst metastatic breast carcinoma.\nIn order to develop an immunomodulatory platform for the delivery of doxorubicin,\nPawar et al. formulated fucoidan-polyethileneimine nanoparticles using a polyelectrolyte\ncomplexation technique [ 179]. The in vitro release study showed that the drug was released\nfaster at acidic pH 5.5, compared to neutral pH 7.4. In both media the particles demonstrated\nan initial burst release within the \ufb01rst 24 h, followed by a sustained release. Furthermore,\ndoxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles showed a greater cytotoxic effect on MDA MB-231 and\n4T1 cell lines compared to free daunorubicin. The in vivo anticancer assay performed on\n4T1 induced tumor in BALB\/c mice con\ufb01rmed the targeted delivery of doxorubicin to the\ntumor site.\nSelf-assembled nanoparticles based on a combination of fucoidan with polyallylamine\nwere formulated as drug carriers for methotrexate. The developed polymer nanosystems\ndemonstrated signi\ufb01cant inhibition of the proliferation of HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines [ 149].\nIn another study, fucoidan was used to functionalize doxorubicin-loaded micelles [ 184]. The\naverage size of the developed structures was 120 nm and their zeta potential was \u221220 mV .\nThe biodistribution of the obtained micelles and free doxorubicin was studied in tumor-\ninduced BALB\/c mice 1, 8 and 24 days after administration. Fucoidan-functionalized\ndoxorubicin micelles showed high accumulation at the tumor site and limited distribution\nin the kidneys and liver, making them a promising strategy for the treatment of metastatic\ncancer.\nKang et al. developed doxorubicin-loaded fucoidan-coated nanoparticles to overcome\nmultidrug resistance in chemotherapy [ 185]. The obtained particles had an average size\nof 35 nm and a drug encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency of 35%.

To ensure the stability of metal nanoparticles in a biological environment,\nthey are coated with hydrophilic polymers.

Gold nanoparticles coated with fucoidan from F. vesiculosus and loaded with\ndoxorubicin (DOX-Fu AuNP) inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells at a\nconcentration of 3\u201335 \u00b5g\/mL at 24 h. DOX-Fu AuNP were able to induce both early and\nlate apoptosis depending on concentration. DOX -Fu AuNP nanoparticles were also used\nas a contrasting agent for in vitro photoacoustic imaging of breast cancer. This indicates\nthat nanoparticles of this type have the potential to be used widely in both drug delivery\nand diagnosis [112].\nA large number of human tumors express P-selectin which might be considered a\ndiagnostic marker and a target for drug delivery to tumor sites, including metastases [ 113].\nDrug delivery systems were constructed of nanocarriers and fucoidan-based biovectors\nwith P-selectin af\ufb01nity to target tumor cells. These nanosystems containing several an-\nticancer drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin were evaluated as to their antitumor\nef\ufb01cacy and adverse effects. Studies on the distribution of fucoidan-based nanoparticles\nfrom F. vesiculosus in mice with tumors expressing P-selectin revealed selective accumula-\ntion of the nanodrug in the tumor microenvironment within 24 h after injection. Targeting\nP-selectin increased the inhibition of tumor growth in mice by 2.8 fold compared to nanopar-\nticles that did not contain a targeting vector [114].\nLow-molecular-weight fucoidan from Ascophyllum nodosum [115] was used in the de-\nsign of a series of P-selectin-directed contrasting agents for the visualization of in\ufb02ammation\nsites in the human vasculature [ 116\u2013118]. Additionally a68Ga complex of fucoidan from\nF. vesiculosus was used for tracing advanced atherosclerotic plaques with high expression\nof P-selectin in the connected endothelium via PET imaging, successfully discriminating\nthem from endothelium overlying inactive \ufb01brous plaques [ 119]. Apart from evaluating\natherosclerotic plaques, this approach to PET imaging might also be investigated for tumor\ndiagnostics, given that a large number of human tumors, unlike normal tissues, exhibit\nP-selectin overexpression. Taking advantage of P-selectin targeting the fucoidan from\nU. pinnati\ufb01da has already been used to design a theranostic nanogel containing chlorin\ne6 photosensitizing residues, which is a unique agent with the dual functions of tumor\nimaging and antitumor photodynamic therapy [120].\nFinally, F. vesiculosus -derived fucoidan vectors attached to the surface of dextran\ncoated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have recently been reported on as\nMRI contrasting agents and for magnetic hyperthermia therapy [ 98]. The results showed\nthat modifying particles with fucoidan prolongs their circulation time and prevents rapid\nclearance via the reticuloendothelial system.

These potential components are primarily alginates, fucoidans, porphyran, and chitin and its derivatives (V o et\u00a0 al. 2015). These biopolymers are increasingly being studied for use in tissue engineering. Because of their many advantages, including biocompatibility, good availability, and the fact that they can be adapted to the particular purpose or function, they show promise as potential materials for regen-eration of almost all tissues. The most studied and utilized polysaccharides in this area include glycosaminoglycans, starch, cellulose, pectin, chitosan, alginates, agar, pullan, gel-lan, and xanthan gum. Tissue-engineered materials occur in various forms, such as porous and fibrous scaffolds and inject-able hydrogels. In addition, in most cases, they are connected with other polymers, natural or synthetic, or with inorganic nanoparticles. They have been tested, among other things, in regard to the engineering of blood vessels, heart valves, carti-lage and intervertebral disks, bones, skeletal muscle, skin, liver, and nervous tissue.

An important group of bioactive compounds derived from algae are sulfated poly-saccharides. One type of such a compound is agarans, and its known representative is a compound called porphyran. Porphyran is, first and foremost, a good-quality food fiber and is the main ingredient in seaweed called \u201cnori,\u201d one of the major nutrients in Japanese cuisine (Bhatia et\u00a0al. 2008). Another type of sulfated polysaccharide is carrageenans. Carrageenans were first isolated in 1837 and have long been used as gelling agents in the food industry (Liu et\u00a0al. 2015b). Furthermore, they have many medical applications, having for years been used in Ireland as a traditional therapeutic tea and as components of antitussives (Kraan 2012). In addition to polysaccharides, algae contain a number of other phyto-chemicals that provide healthy properties for food. Such compounds include, inter alia, phenolic compounds and fatty acids. Many studies have reported that these compounds are responsible for antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral activity. However, the main component of marine algae, constituting 25\u201375% of dry matter, is dietary fiber. It is primarily responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system and, together with minerals, helps in reduc-ing salt content. An example of algae that are commonly used in Asian cuisine is Undaria pinnatifida. Under the name of miyok, it is being served in the form of soups, salads, and side dishes (Gupta and Abu-Ghannam 2011; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 et\u00a0 al. \n2013).\nNowadays, cosmeceuticals of natural origin are very pop-\nular. Cosmeceuticals are described as cosmetic products con-taining a number of bioactive compounds and providing therapeutic benefits. The healing potential of algae and their constituents is commonly used in the cosmetic industry (Wijesinghe and Jeon 2011). Skin is exposed to a number of harmful factors due to constant contact with the external environment. In particular, solar radiation can be responsible for poor skin conditions. Exposure to ultraviolet light is asso-ciated with a variety of harmful effects, ranging from photo-reception to skin cancer. Skin lesions include, inter alia, pigmentation, telangiectasia, erythema, wrinkles, actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and many others (Bowszyc-Dmochowska 2010).

In poultry feed, up to 5\u201310\n % can be safely replaced \nwith \nalgal biomass as a partial replacement for conventional proteins. Any higher con-centrations, however, can result in undesirable effects such as reduced growth rate and changes in color and flavor of chicken eggs (Becker 2004). In pigs, algae can \nreplace conventional proteins such as soybean or fish meal without serious issues. It has been suggested that at least 33\n % \nof the total protein supplied can be replaced \nwithout adverse effects (Becker 2004).\n2.3  Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important for many aspects of human health. Recently, attention has been focused especially on omega-3 fatty acids be-cause of their association with many health benefits. Fish and other seafood are good sources of these substances, but safety issues arise because fish can also ac-cumulate mercury or other toxins, making them less safe for consumption (Spolaore et\n al. 2006\n). Due to a growing world population and overfishing, marine fish are \nnot a sustainable source of PUFAs. Marine microalgae are a source of commercial omega-3 PUFAs, and macroalgae have also been shown to be a significant source of PUFAs (Venugopal 2009). Algae, in fact, are the primary producers of basic fatty acids in marine food webs (Berg\u00e9 and Barnathan 2005). PUFAs from algae also \nhave the advantage of being vegetarian in nature.\nSolvent extraction is used to extract PUFAs from algae. Because of concern for \npreservation of the product, supercritical carbon dioxide has been used in some cases (Peretti et\n \nal. 2003; Venugopal 2009).\nMany positive health effects have been linked with the consumption of PUFAs, \nespecially the omega-3s. Venugopal (2009) provides a list of nutraceutical poten-tials of omega-3 fatty acids. Consumption of these PUFAs can possibly prevent atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, reduce blood pressure, reduce symptoms in asthma patients, fight against manic-depressive illness, protect against chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, alleviate symptoms of cystic fibrosis, prevent relapses in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, prevent various cancers, provide bone health, and improve brain functions in children (Venugopal 2009). The omega-3 Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important component of tissue in the brain, nervous system, and eye (Venugopal 2009). Because of this, DHA is very important in the development of infants, as well as in growing chil -\ndren. A few studies have shown improvement in behavior of children whose diets have been supplemented with fatty acids, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Venugopal 2009; Young and Conquer 2008).\nAlgae-derived PUFAs, such as DHA and Eicopentaenoic acid (EPA), are al-\nready commercially available as supplements that can be purchased at many nutri-K.

Due to SA and JD both located in the west coast of Korea, we deduced that the chemi -\ncal content of the different PPP extracts was mildly influenced by their geographic location, and this alga has potential \nof protective activity against AAPH-induced ROS both  in vitro  and in vivo .  \nKey Words:  antioxidant effect; Gim; polyphenols; proteins; Pyropia yezoensis ; zebrafish \nAbbreviations:  AAPH, 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; DCFH-DA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein di -\nacetate; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DPPH, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl; DPPP , diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine; FBS, \nfetal bovine serum; HN, Haenam; JaH, Jangheung; JD, Jindo; JiH, Jinhae; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphe -\nnyltetrazolium bromide; PPP , polyphenols and proteins-rich extracts from P . yezoensis ; ROS, reactive oxygen species; \nRPMI, Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium; SA, Sinan; WD, Wando\nReceived  October 30, 2019,  Accepted  May 14, 2020\n*Corresponding Author\nE-mail: youjinj@jejunu.ac.kr\nTel: +82-64-754-3475,   Fax: +82-64-756-3493This is an Open Access article distributed under the \nterms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Com -\nmercial License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/3.0\/) which \npermits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction \nin any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nDocument 774: Dai et al.   Protective Effect of Korean Pyropia yezoensis197\nhttp:\/\/e-algae.orgIn pharmacological studies, the zebrafish, as an in \nvivo  model, has unique advantages, such as large clutch \nsize, transparent embryos, low cost, and easy handling. \nHence, it is routinely used for screening in predictive tox -\nicology (Howe et al. 2013). In the zebrafish model, lipid \nperoxidation was evaluated using a fluorescent probe \nDPPP , which shows diminished fluorescence under per -\noxidized conditions. Cell death was observed in zebraf -\nish embryos by acridine orange staining, a nucleic acid-\nspecific metachromatic dye (Kim et al. 2014 a). We have \nalso validated our hypothesis using zebrafish embryos \nas an in vivo model system. The PPP from SA inhibited \nthe AAPH-simulated cell death and ROS generation in ze -\nbrafish. Lipid peroxidation is a well-characterized toxico -\nlogical phenomenon that is most commonly initiated by \nROS. The free radical generator and AAPH can stimulate \nlipid peroxidation in cells leading to cell death (Yokozawa \net al. 1997). Recent studies reported that stimulator-in -\nduced lipid peroxidation in zebrafish embryos was de -\ncreased by the polyphenol-rich fraction obtained from \nseaweeds (Kim et al. 2014 c). It was proven that PPP from \nKorean Gim (SA) has a strong protective effect against \nlipid peroxidation and cell death in AAPH-treated ze -\nbrafish embryos. Lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction \nin which the reaction of lipids with a free radical gener -\nates lipid hydroperoxide and peroxyl-fatty acid radicals; \nthese subsequently attack different biological molecules \nresulting in a sustained reaction that can induce phys -\niochemical alterations, ultimately leading to cell death \n(Miki et al. 1987). Hence, PPP from SA exerted protective \neffects against the damage caused by lipid peroxidation. \nIn this study, subsequently, the free radical scaveng -\ning and protective activities of PPP on AAPH-stimulated \noxidative stress using cells and zebrafish embryos were \nevaluated. PPP extracts from P . yezoensis  obtained from \nsix locations were analyzed. Of these, SA and JD con -\ntained relatively higher contents of polyphenols and pro -\ntein and showed the strongest radical scavenging activity \nagainst AAPH and the protective activity of PPP against \nAAPH-simulated intracellular ROS production and cell \ndeath of Vero cells. Finally, it was found that Korean Gim \nfrom SA and JD strongly inhibited AAPH-simulated cell \ndeath, ROS generation, and lipid peroxidation in zebraf -\nish. \nThus, our studies using Vero cells and zebrafish em -\nbryos have demonstrated the antioxidant, free radical \nscavenging, and protective activities of the polyphenol \nand protein-rich extract of P . yezoensis . The product from \nSA and JD, which located southwestern coast of Korea, \nshowed the strongest antioxidant activity partly because P . yezoensis  from six regions where major Pyropia  aqua -\nfarms locates screened their antioxidant effects both in \nvitro and  in vivo. \nEnvironmental stressors such as cold shock and UV-\nrays as well as biotic stressors like viral infection cause the \naccumulation of ROS, leading to lipid peroxidation, cell \ndamage, and death. AAPH is a water-soluble compound \nthat has long been known to be a free radical generator \n(Niki 1990). In this study, we used AAPH to induce oxida -\ntive stress in Vero cells and zebrafish embryos. Typically \npolyphenols are rich in brown seaweed (Namvar et al. \n2013), and they exhibit strong antioxidant activity against \nDPPH, hydroxyl, and peroxyl radicals (Kang et al. 2012). \nThere have been very few studies on the extracts of red \nseaweed and their bioactivity and polyphenol content, \nparticularly because of the lower levels of these com -\npounds in these seaweeds than brown seaweeds. Hence, \nthe content and antioxidant effects of polyphenols ex -\ntracted from the red seaweed P . yezoensis , collected from \ndifferent areas, were studied.

It has been found to exhibit antiviral activity and has been used in the formulation of nasal sprays to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Lambda-carrageenan has shown potent antiviral activity against laboratory strains of IAV and IBV viruses, and primary isolation of SARS-CoV-2. It is more soluble in cold water compared to kappa- and iota-carrageenan due to its higher sulfate content. This makes lambda-carrageenan a promising antiviral seaweed polysaccharide that can also be used in nasal spray formulations.","reference_context":"Document 3464: 3 Biotech (2022) 12:154 \n1 3 Page 11 of 15 154\nThis efficient blockage of the SARS-COV-2 spike pro-\ntein binding to ACE-2 receptor by carrageenan was further \nconfirmed. Morokutti-Kurz, Graf, Grassauer, and Prieschl-\nGrassauer (2020) described the in\u00a0vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 \nactivities of carrageenan. They suggested that the iota-carra-\ngeenan is a safe compound for the treatment of coronavirus \ninfection because their study revealed the iota-carrageenan \ninterference in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus \n(SSPL) entry with an  IC50 value of 2.6\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121. Moreover, \nthe same result was obtained against various Rhino- and \nCoronaviruses. Iota-carrageenan not only exhibited the \ninhibitory activity against SSPL at 10\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121, but also \nwas active at 100\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121 concentration. While kappa-\ncarrageenan and lambda-carrageenan were only active at \n100\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121. Nevertheless, iota-carrageenan had stronger \nantiviral activity rather than the others (Morokutti-Kurz \net\u00a0al. 2020). Mechanistically, a binding competition between \nanionic groups of sulfated polysaccharides and cationic \nregions of virus envelope glycoprotein was proposed as a \npotential mode of action for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by car -\nrageenan (Jang et\u00a0al. 2021).\nIn addition, the algal-derived nasal spray can be a promis-\ning self-administered antiviral spray. In\u00a0vitro study against \nin Vero cell culture showed the effective reduction in SARS-\nCov-2 infection by iota carrageenan at least concentration \nof 6\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121, while antiviral activity could promote by the \ncombination of 5% m  V\u22121 xylitol (Bansal et\u00a0al. 2020). Simi-\nlarly, Jang et\u00a0al. (2021) reported potent antiviral activity, the \nefficacy of lambda-carrageenan against laboratory strains of \nIAV and IBV viruses, and primary isolation of SARS-CoV-2 \nwith an  EC50 value of 0.3\u20131.4\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121 and 0.9\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0  mL\u22121, \nrespectively. Regarding its cytotoxicity, the  CC50 concentra-\ntion for lambda- carrageenan was safe up to 300\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0  mL\u22121. \nAccording to the analysis, lambda-carrageenan treatment \ninduced gene expression reduction of viral proteins and \nprevention of virus production in Vero cell culture. Inter -\nestingly, lambda-carrageenan is composed of (1,3)-linked \n\u03b1-d-galactose-2-sulfated and (1,4)-linked \u03b2- d-galactose-\n2,6,-disulfat units. Lambda-carrageenan is more soluble in \ncold water compare with kappa- and iota-carrageenan due to \nits higher sulfate content (32\u201339% of ester sulfate degree). \nThus lambda-carrageenan is a promising antiviral seaweed \npolysaccharide applicable in nasal spray formulation (Jang \net\u00a0al. 2021).\nIn order to harness the SARS-Cov-2 inactivating power \nof algal sulfated polysaccharides, new nasal and oral sprays \nwere formulated by carrageenan. Hui (2020) suggested the \npovidone-iodine and carrageenan-containing sprays as a \npromising candidate for chemoprophylaxis and suppression \nof the coronavirus outbreak. In parallel with this observation, \nSch\u00fctz et\u00a0al. ( 2021) applied two types of nose and mouth \nsprays formulated by iota- and kappa- carrageenan with \n1.2\u00a0mg\u00a0  mL\u22121 and 0.4\u00a0mg\u00a0  mL\u22121 concentration, respectively. Both types of sprays exhibited the anti-COVID-19 activity \nbecause of their polyanionic structure properties. Therefore, \nusing carrageenan-based sprays could be useful to eradicate \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nSimilarly, the in\u00a0vitro respiratory epithelium model \ntreated with nasal spray formulated with iota-carrageenan \n(1.7\u00a0mg\u00a0  mL\u22121) and sodium chloride showed adequate inhibi-\ntion against SARS-CoV-2 (Varese et\u00a0al. 2021).\nClinical trial\nThere are a few clinical trials about the anti-SARS-CoV-2 \nactivity of carrageenan and fucoidan, while these two \nsulfated polysaccharides are suitable for anti-COVID-19 \nresearches.

When\nusing\u03b9- and k-carrageenan at the same time, the physical interaction of carrageenan with\nthe virus did not interfere with the inhibitory effect of zanamivir, and the spray effect was\nincreased [ 58]. Xylimidazolines have been used for over 50 years to relieve vasoconstric-\ntion and acute nasal edema. Graf et al combine this vasoconstrictor and \u03b9-carrageenan\nin a scienti\ufb01c formulation. The experimental results show that \u03b9-carrageenan does not\nreduce the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of the drug, and the antiviral effect of iota-carrageenan is\nalso not affected [ 64]. Therefore, the most successful antiviral formulation of carrageenan\nmay be the recently developed nasal spray formulation for use against rhinoviruses and\nSARS-CoV-2 [63,64].\n2.1.2. Galactan\nSulfated galactans are the principal extracellular polysaccharides found in red seaweed.\nWith few exceptions, they consist mainly of linear chains of galactose. These polysaccha-\nrides show good antiviral activity against HSV , DENV , HIV , and HAV [ 67\u201370]. Galactan\nfrom the red alga Agardhiella tenera has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection\nby preventing the interaction between HIV gp120 and the CD4 + T cell receptor [ 69,71].\nSimilarly, 12.5 \u00b5g\/mL galactan isolated from Schizymenia binderi was found to inhibit HIV\nreplication in vitro , and block the replication of HSV-1 in Vero cells [ 72]. Matsuhiro et al.\nfound that Schizymenia binderi galactan showed strongly selective antiviral activity against\nHSV-1 and HSV-2, with EC50 values of 0.76 and 0.63 \u00b5g\/mL, respectively [ 73]. Similarly,\n3 galactan (F1, F2, and F3) isolated from Callophyllis variegate are effective inhibitors of\nHSV-1 and HSV-2, with IC50 values ranging from 0.16 to 2.19 \u00b5g\/mL, and are effective\nagainst DENV-2 with IC50s in the range of 0.10\u20130.41 \u00b5g\/mL [ 74]. The galactan (C2S-3)\nextracted from Cryptonemia crenulata can inhibit the proliferation of DENV-2 in Vero cell\nlines [ 75]. The result of the experiment showed that C2S-3 blocked the initial binding of the\nvirus to cells and its subsequent penetration, preventing DENV-2 from RNA replication\nand other biomacromolecule synthesis functions in host cells. Moreover, compared with\nheparin, C2S-3 was more effective as an antiviral against various DENV-2 strains [ 75].\nTherefore, galactan is a very promising antiviral drug.\n2.2. Brown Seaweed\n2.2.1. Fucoidan\nFucoidan is an intercellular or mucilage matrix component of brown seaweed, account-\ning for approximately 5\u201320% of the dry weight of the plant [ 76,77]. Fucoidan is documented\nto be effective against a wide variety of viruses, including HIV , HSV , and SARS-CoV-2, and\nnumerous other RNA and DNA viruses [ 78\u201384]. Dinesh et al. extracted fucoidan (CFF,\nFF1, and FF2) from Sargassum swartzii , observing that the FF2 fraction was effective against\nHIV-1 at concentrations between 1.56 and 6.25 \u00b5g\/mL, shown by signi\ufb01cant reductions in\nthe p24 antigen levels (95.6 \u00b11.1%) and reverse transcriptase ( 78.9\u00b11.43% ) at a concen-\ntration of 25 \u00b5g\/mL [ 81]. Fucoidans isolated from Dictyota mertensii ,Lobophora variegate ,\nFucusvesiculosus, and Spatoglossum schroederi were found to inhibit HIV reverse transcrip-\ntases, thus preventing infection; it was further observed that the antiviral action was\npositively associated with the numbers of sulfate moieties on the compound [ 85]. Lee\net al. demonstrated that the fucoidan extracted from Mekabu and Sargassum trichophyllum\nsigni\ufb01cantly inhibited HSV-1, HSV-2, H5N3, and in\ufb02uenza A viral infection together with\nenhancing the immune function [ 86]. High-molecular-weight fucoidan (KW) from the\nbrown alga Kelmanella crassifolia was shown to bind and block in\ufb02uenza A virus neu-\nraminidase activity, inhibiting the release of viral particles. Fucoidan was also found to\nblock EGFR and subsequent activation of downstream PI3K\/Akt and NF- \u03baB signaling [ 87].\n\nDocument 5634: 3 Biotech (2022) 12:154\n1 3 154 Page 12 of 15\nTherefore, more investigations are needed to evaluate the \nside effects of fucoidan on human health in various study \nmodels.\nConclusion\nIt is noteworthy that several recent works have stated that \nnumerous poly sulfated compounds are considered for their \ninhibitory potential for the virus attachment and replication. \nIn the past decade, sulfated polysaccharides were mainly \nderived from seaweeds because of their antiviral properties. \nSeveral studies confirmed that various fucoidan and carra-\ngeenan preparations have been shown to exhibit a wide spec-\ntrum of antivirus activity and propose a potential approach \nto the use of natural seaweed metabolites to tackle the cur -\nrent pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, seaweed-derived \nfunctional foods can provide health benefits by reducing \nthe risk of diseases and enhancing the immune body sys-\ntem, thus improving the quality of life. Thus, promoting the \nutilization of a healthy diet containing seaweeds or the pro-\nduction of functional foods will be suggested. Considering \nthe role of structural properties of fucoidan and carrageenan, \nthey are highly valuable in face masks and other medical and \nhygiene materials. Therefore, more attention should be paid \nto the scale-up of production and application of fucoidan as \na novel algal-based medicine.\nAcknowledgements The work was financially supported by Shiraz \nUniversity of Medical Sciences under project number 23643 and Shi-\nraz University (Grant number: 96GCU5M1984).\nAuthor contributions NO: investigation and writing original draft; \nMM-N: supervision and editing; SMM: funding acquisition and pro-\nject administration.\nDeclarations  \nConflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\nAbd El Hamid MI, Abd El Fatah WM, El Morsi AA, Draz MS, \nKallakuri S, Bungau S, Hafez E (2019) Anti-HIV\/HCV activ -\nity of cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins by a new standardized \nmethod using bacteriophage surrogates.

Experimental Section\n3.1. Reagents\nLMWF was obtained from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum using a radical\ndepolymerization process adapted from Nardella et al. [49], as previously described [2,6,7,11,50].\nThe average molecular weight of the fraction used is 4500 Da (polydispersity 1.7), the fucose content\nis 35% (w\/w), the uronic acid content is 3% (w\/w) and the sulfate content is 34% (w\/w). We used the\nLMWH enoxaparin from Sano\ufb01-Aventis. Its average molecular weight is 4500 Da (polydispersity 1.3),\nand its sulfate content is 40% (w\/w), which is very close to the LMWF fraction that we are using in this\nstudy. The structures of LMWF and LMWH are represented in [35]. Recombinant human VEGFA-165\nwas purchased from Abcys (Paris, France) recombinant human FGF-2 from R&D systems (Abingdon,\nUK) and wortmanin from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA, USA)\n3.2. ECFC Isolation and Culture\nMononuclear cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood by density gradient\ncentrifugation as previously described [10]. After an adhesion step, CD34+ cells were selected by\nmagnetic activated cell sorting. The cells thus collected were plated on 0.2% gelatin-coated 24-well\nplastic culture dishes at a density of 5 \u02c6105cells\/well in EGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville,\nMD, USA). After 4 days, non adherent cells were removed and the medium was renewed.\nAfter 10\u201320 days of culture, ECFC colonies became visible microscopically. Cells were then\ndetached with trypsin and expanded in EGM-2 on 0.2% gelatin coated plates and grown at 37\u02ddC\nin a humidi\ufb01ed 5% CO 2atmosphere for further analysis. ECFC were used 25 to 45 days after cord\nblood processing. ECFCs were positive for CD31, CD34, CD144 and CD146 but not for the monocytic\nmarkers CD45 and CD14. (For complete ECFC characterization, see [10]).\n3.3. HUVEC Isolation and Culture\nEndothelial cells from the vein of human umbilical cord were isolated by enzymatic digestion\nwith collagenase as previously described [7] and cultured on 0.2% gelatin coated plates, in EGM-2\nmedium in a humidi\ufb01ed 5% CO 2atmosphere at 37\u02ddC. HUVECs were used at passage 2 or 3.\n3.4. Bio-Plex\u00aeAnalysis\nECFCs and HUVECs were seeded in 6-well 0.2% gelatin coated plates at a density of\n2\u02c6105cells\/well. Two days later, when cells reached subcon\ufb02uence they were placed overnight\nin EBM-2 + 5% FCS. The next morning, cells were washed with PBS and serum starved for 4 h in\nEBM-2.Cells were then stimulated during 15 min with FGF2 (5 ng\/mL) or VEGFA-165 (40 ng\/mL),\nin association with LMWF (10 \u00b5g\/mL) or not. Cells were then washed and lysed using the\nBio-Plex\u00aecell lysis kit (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). We used the BCA protein assay to ensure equal\namounts of protein in all the lysates. Lysates were incubated with microbeads from Biorad coupled\nwith antibodies speci\ufb01c to the following proteins: phospho-AKT (171V210752), phospho-ERK1\/2\n(171V222382), phospho-p38 (171V213362), phospho-JNK (171V210342), total AKT (171V310752), total\nERK1\/2 (171V322382), total p38 (171V313362), total JNK (171V310342), processed according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol, and analyzed using a Bio-plex\u00aesuspension array system.

On the other hand, low-molecular-weight fucoidans may\nhave proangiogenic activity due to their ability to modulate heparin-binding growth factors,\nsuch as FGF-2 [ 51]. Indeed, it has been shown that the effect of fucoidans on angiogene-\n\nDocument 2012: Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 11821 5 of 17\nsis largely depends on their molecular weight: antiangiogenic activity is associated with\nhigh-molecular fucoidans, whereas low-molecular fractions can function as proangiogenic\nagents [52].\n5. Anticoagulant and Antithrombotic Activities\nThrombosis is a frequent complication of cancer and is considered to be one of the\nmain causes of death of cancer patients [ 53]. Oncological disease is known to increase the\nrisk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by 4\u20137 fold. One treatment option\nfor hypercoagulation and venous thromboembolism is heparin (low-molecular-weight\nheparins)\u2013one of the most widely used intravenous anticoagulants, exhibiting a unique\npolyanionic structure [ 54,55]. However, extensive heparin treatment is limited due to its\nhemorrhagic effect and the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [ 56]. Evidently,\nit is necessary to expand the number of anticoagulants by developing effective drugs\nwith fewer adverse effects. Fucoidans exhibit anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity\nmediated by heparin cofactor II and other blood-clotting factors [ 57]. These effects are also\nassociated with ability of sulfated polysaccharides to potentiate the interaction of thrombin\nwith antithrombin (ATIII) or heparin cofactor II (HCII) Other pathways include direct\ninhibition of thrombin and factor Xa [ 58]. Fucoidans with a higher molecular weight tend\nto show a more pronounced anticoagulant effect while a certain sulfation rate is essential\nfor anticoagulant activity [59,60].\nA single blind clinical study evaluated the anticoagulant activity of fucoidan from\nUndaria pinnati\ufb01da , with 10 subjects receiving 3 g of fucoidan capsules for 12 days (the\n10 subjects in the control group received guar gum capsules). Despite the fact that pre-\nliminary in vitro studies had revealed a pronounced anticoagulant activity of the studied\nfucoidan, no effect on hemostasis in vivo was apparent, probably due to low intestinal\nabsorption [61].\n6. Immunoregulatory Activity\nMany pharmacological effects of fucoidan including antiviral and antitumor activity\nare largely explained by its ability to modulate cellular immunity [ 62\u201364]. It is assumed that\nfucoidans bind to various receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors on dendritic cells and\nmacrophages and monocytes, inducing the release of cytokines and chemokines necessary\nfor an immune response [40].\nNumerous studies have con\ufb01rmed the effect of fucoidans on immune regulation.\nIn particular, fucoidan from F. vesiculosus enhanced the production of TNF- \u03b1and IL-6 by\nperitoneal macrophages [ 65]. In addition, fucoidan has been found to contribute to the\nimprovement of the Th1\/Th2 immune balance [43].\nA randomized double-blind parallel placebo-controlled cohort study evaluated the ef-\nfect of fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus on the activity of human NK cells.\nThe main cohort included 20 subjects who received fucoidan orally in a single dose of 3 g\nfor 12 weeks. NK cell activity was shown to be signi\ufb01cantly higher in the cohort receiving\nfucoidan than in the reference cohort [ 66]. Fucoidan also activated the growth of T and B\ncells in the spleen. It was found [ 67] that fucoidans with different molecular weights had\nvarying effects on the proliferation of NK and T cells, with high-molecular-weight fucoidan\nincreasing the ratio of cytotoxic T-cells [ 65]. In addition, fucoidans were able to activate\nphagocytes, including macrophages [68].\n7. Anti-In\ufb02ammatory Activity\nChronic in\ufb02ammation can stimulate the development and progression of tumors [ 69].\nThe in\ufb02ammatory reaction in cancer patients may result from intensive antitumor treatment,\nsuch as extended operations and chemotherapy, and it is mediated by increased levels of\nin\ufb02ammatory mediators and reactive radicals, particularly NO [ 70]. An important role in\nthe development of the in\ufb02ammatory reaction in cancer patients is the disruption of the\n\nDocument 5083: dues.21,24,29Substantial biological activities of fucoidan from\ndi\ufb00erent brown algae have recently been de \ufb01ned.30\u221232\nHigher sulfate groups containing fucoidan manifested\nstronger antioxidant, antiviral, anticoagulant, and immunomo-dulatory activities.

Asterochloris  phyco -\nbionts associated with the lichenized fungi Cladonia and  Stereocaulon  in King George Island (Antarctica) and Morro \nChico (Chile), were isolated and then used to establish clonal cultures. To understand the phylogenetic relationships \nand species diversity of Antarctic Asterochloris species, molecular and morphological data were analyzed by using three \nmicroscopy techniques (light, confocal laser and transmission electron) and a multi-locus phylogeny with data from \nthe nuclear-encoded internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA and the actin and plastid-encoded ribulose bisphosphate \ncarboxylase large chain ( rbcL) coding genes. Morphological data of three Antarctic strains showed significant species-\nspecific features in chloroplast while molecular data segregated the taxa into distinct three clades as well. Each species \nhad unique molecular signatures that could be found in secondary structures of the ITS1 and ITS2. The species diversity \nof Antarctic Asterochloris  was represented by six taxa, namely, A. glomerata , A. italiana , A. sejongensis , and three new \nspecies ( A. antarctica , A. pseudoirregularis , A. stereocaulonicola ).\nKey Words:  Antarctica; Asterochloris ; lichen; photobiont; phylogeny; taxonomy; Trebouxiophyceae\nINTRODUCTION\nLichens are among the best-known examples of sym -\nbiotic organisms and consist of fungal partners (my -\ncobionts) and photosynthetic eukaryotic algal (phy -\ncobionts) or cyanobacterial (cyanobionts) partners. \nLichens are biologically and ecologically important in \nterrestrial environments due to their influence on global \ncarbon and nitrogen circulation, playing an essential role \nduring early ecological succession (Fern\u00e1ndez-Mendoza \net al. 2011, Elbert et al. 2012, P\u00e9rez-Ortega et al. 2012, \nBorchhardt et al. 2017). Within lichen associations, the \nlichen-forming phycobionts transfer carbohydrates to the heterotrophic host in the form of sugar alcohol or \nglucose (Richardson et al. 1967, Richardson and Smith \n1968), while mycobionts protect their partners from so -\nlar radiation and harsh environmental conditions such \nas extreme temperature fluctuations and desiccation \n(Honegger 2012). These partners have species selectiv -\nity, meaning that they correspond to each other, but not \nalways in a one-to-one manner (Chodat 1913, Jaag 1929, \nRaths 1938, Kroken and Taylor 2000, Piercey-Normore \nand DePriest 2001, Muggia et al. 2018).

Although these \ntwo species are closely related, they have morphological \ndifferences and many unique molecular signatures, sug -\ngesting that A. stereocaulonicola is differentiated from A. \nleprarii .\nIn ultrastructural studies of chloroplasts, the thylakoid \nmembranes in the pyrenoid matrix were associated with \npyrenoglobuli (Fisher and Lang 1971), and the form and \narrangement of chloroplast thylakoids was divided into \nsix categories (Friedl 1989). However, these patterns were \nnot reflected in the phylogenetic relationships among \nthe species. According to the morphological type of py -\nrenoids described by Friedl (1989), two new species, \nnamely, A. pseudoirregularis  and A. streocaulonicola , \nhad irregularis-type pyrenoids, while A. antarctica  had \ngigantea- or impressa-type pyrenoids. When the pyre -\nnoid types were mapped onto our Bayesian tree, the \nultrastructure data were not congruent with the phylo -\ngenetic tree, suggesting that diverse pyrenoid types may \nhave arisen independently in the evolutionary history \nof the genus Asterochloris . For example, irregularis-type \npyrenoids were distributed in diverse clades in our phy -\nlogenetic tree ( Fig. 6): A. excentrica , A. glomerata , A. ir -\nregularis , A. italiana , A. pseudoirregularis , A. sejongensis , \nand A. stereocaulonicola . A. antarctica  has gigantea- and \nimpressa-type pyrenoids, but A. sejongensis  has irregula -\nris-type pyrenoids, even though the two species are in -\ncluded in the same lineage.\nIn summary, the phylogenetic tree based on the com -\nbined nuclear ITS, actin, and rbcL sequence data had a \ntopology similar to that of recently published phylog -\nenies (Moya et al. 2015, \u0160kaloud et al. 2015, Kim et al. \n2017), and the genus was largely divided into two clades \nwith moderate to high support values. The phylogenetic \nrelationships among the members of Asterochloris  were \nnot fully resolved in clade B of our tree, but each species \nformed a monophyletic clade despite the morphology \nbeing misleading for species identification. Compared \nwith closely related species, the three new species had \nunique CBCs, hemi-CBCs and single-base changes in \nITS secondary structures, supporting that the new spe -\ncies were differentiated from closely related species in \nthe tree. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Korea Polar Research \nInstitute (PE15020) and the National Research Founda -but the pyrenoid type may be similar to the corticolar-\ntype according to Friedl (1989).

CdSe \/ZnS core \/shell quantum dots (QDs, 620 nm and 520 nm) were purchased from\nOcean Nanotech (Springdale, AR, USA). Docetaxel ( \u226599.5%) (DTX) was purchased from Scinopharm\n(Shan-Hua, Taiwan). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-\ntetrazolium (MTS reagent) was purchased from Promega Co.

Fluorescence mounting medium was purchased from Dako\n(Agilent Technologies, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Phosphate-bu \ufb00ered saline (PBS) was purchased from\nAMRESCO (Solon, OH, USA). All chemicals and solvents were of analytical reagent grade.\n2.2. Methods\n2.2.1. Preparation of Docetaxel-Encapsulated Fucoidan\u2013PLGA Nanoparticles (FPNs\u2013DTX)\nDocetaxel (DTX) was used as a model drug to form FPNs\u2013DTX and was useful to evaluate the\ndrug loading and release behavior of these nanoparticles. The FPNs\u2013DTX were fabricated by the\nemulsion and solvent evaporation method. The organic solvent (50 \u00b5L chloroform) comprising PLGA\n(3 mg) and DTX (1 mg) was prepared and added to the fucoidan (0.5% w\/v, 2 mL) aqueous solution.\nThe mixed solution was subsequently emulsi\ufb01ed by a probe ultrasonicator (UP200Ht-Handheld\nUltrasonic Homogenizer, Hielscher Ultrasonics, Teltow, Germany) at the power of 10 W and the\nfrequency of 26 kHz to form an oil-in-water emulsion. The organic solvent was then removed at\n55\u25e6C and the FPNs\u2013DTX were washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the yield of FPN\nnanoparticles was about 18.4% ( w\/w). The abbreviations and compositions of all formulations used in\n\nDocument 5243: okamuranus fucoidan in a rat mode [ 30]. The result showed that only 0.1% could be absorbed in Caco-2\ncells. However, Kimura et al. [ 31] found that liposome NPs could improve the bioavailability of\nsulfated polysaccharide. Therefore, nanosystems or nanoparticles have been developed to promote\nthe bioavailability of fucoidan. Thus, Fucoidan with PLGA was chosen in this study to develop\nnanoparticles as a drug delivery system.\nDocetaxel (DTX), used as a model drug in this study, has shown highly cytotoxic activity in several\ntypes of cancer including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers [ 32,33], but its clinical application\nis restricted owing to its poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and cumulative systemic toxicity\nafter prolonged and high-dose therapy [ 34]. Therefore, DTX is usually dissolved in Tween80: ethanol\n(50:50, v \/v) to enhance its solubility, but these solvent-based DTX formulations easily cause toxic e \ufb00ects,\nincluding neutropenia, hypersensitivity, \ufb02uid retention, nail toxicities, and neuropathy. To enhance the\nbioavailability and anticancer activity, research has focused on entrapping DTX in nanocarriers such as\n\nDocument 2006: biomolecules\nArticle\nDevelopment and Characterization of a\nFucoidan-Based Drug Delivery System by Using\nHydrophilic Anticancer Polysaccharides to\nSimultaneously Deliver Hydrophobic\nAnticancer Drugs\nYen-Ho Lai1, Chih-Sheng Chiang2, Chin-Hao Hsu1, Hung-Wei Cheng1\nand San-Yuan Chen1,3,4,5,*\n1Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan;\nangus80817@gmail.com (Y.-H.L.); eddy610061@hotmail.com (C.-H.H.); mlb14756@gmail.com (H.-W.C.)\n2Cell Therapy Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40454, Taiwan; brian78630g@gmail.com\n3Frontier Research Centre on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University,\nHsinchu 30013, Taiwan\n4School of Dentistry, College of Dental Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan\n5Graduate Institute of Biomedical Science, China Medical University, Taichung 40454, Taiwan\n*Correspondence: sanyuanchen@mail.nctu.edu.tw; Tel.: +886-3573-1818\nReceived: 4 June 2020; Accepted: 26 June 2020; Published: 28 June 2020\n\/gid00030\/gid00035\/gid00032\/gid00030\/gid00038\/gid00001\/gid00033\/gid00042\/gid00045 \/gid00001\n\/gid00048\/gid00043\/gid00031\/gid00028\/gid00047\/gid00032\/gid00046\nAbstract: Fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide, which can activate the immune response\nand lessen adverse e \ufb00ects, is expected to be an adjuvant agent in combination with chemotherapy.\nUsing natural hydrophilic anticancer polysaccharides to simultaneously encapsulate hydrophobic\nanticancer drugs is feasible, and a reduced side e \ufb00ect can be achieved to amplify the therapeutic\ne\ufb03cacy. In this study, a novel type of fucoidan-PLGA nanocarrier (FPN-DTX) was developed\nfor the encapsulation of the hydrophobic anticancer drug, docetaxel (DTX), as a drug delivery\nsystem. From the comparison between FPN-DTX and the PLGA particles without fucoidan\n(PLGA-DTX), FPNs\u2013DTX with fucoidan were highly stable with smaller sizes and dispersed well\nwithout aggregations in an aqueous environment. The drug loading and release can be further\nmodi\ufb01ed by modulating relative ratios of Fucoidan (Fu) to PLGA. The (FPN 3-DTX) nanoparticles\nwith a 10:3 ratio of Fu:PLGA displayed uniform particle size with higher encapsulation e \ufb03ciency\nthan PLGA NPs and sustained drug release ability. The biocompatible fucoidan-PLGA nanoparticles\ndisplayed low cytotoxicity without drug loading after incubation with MDA-MB-231 triple-negative\nbreast cancer cells. Despite lower cellular uptake than that of PLGA-DTX due to a higher degree of\nnegative zeta potential and hydrophilicity, FPN 3-DTX e \ufb00ectively exerted better anticancer ability,\nso FPN 3-DTX can serve as a competent drug delivery system.\nKeywords: fucoidan; PLGA; docetaxel; drug delivery system; anticancer therapy \/cancer treatment\n1. Introduction\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and a major reason for the limited\ntherapeutic e \ufb03cacy against cancer is the di \ufb03culty to deliver therapeutic agents precisely and e \ufb00ectively\nto the tumor sites without inducing severe adverse e \ufb00ects on healthy tissues and organs [ 1,2].\nDrug delivery systems (DDS) such as micelles, vesicles \/liposomes, nanocapsules, porous particles,\nnanospheres, and inorganic nanoparticles have emerged to resolve therapeutic issues by enhancing the\naccumulation of active pharmaceutical molecules in tumor sites [ 3].

Photoautotrophic biomass production is the photosynthetic mode of growth, which utilizes inorganic salts and compounds in the presence of a light source.","reference_context":"Document 1912: 86\n2009; Chiu et\u00a0al. 2009; Hu and Sato 2017). The soluble carbonates like NaHCO 3 \nand Na 2CO 3 as well as any external carbon dioxide source from power plant are \nused in the production unit (Hsueh et\u00a0al. 2007; Doucha et\u00a0al. 2005; Abu Hajar et\u00a0al. \n2017). It also requires other inorganic compounds such as silicon, phosphorus, and \nnitrogen (Suh and Lee 2003, Halim et\u00a0al. 2011). There are three major mechanisms \nof biomass production based on its nutrient requirement such as:\n\u2022 Photoautotrophic biomass production\n\u2022 Heterotrophic biomass production\n\u2022 Mixotrophic biomass production\n4.3.1.1  Photoautotrophic Biomass Production\nPhotoautotrophic biomass production is the photosynthetic mode of growth, which \nutilizes inorganic salts and compounds in the presence of a light source. This mode \nof production is the economically viable process which can be carried out through \ntwo conventional methods as follows:\n4.3.1.1.1 Open Pond Production Unit\nThe open pond cultivation of microalgae is the cheaper and convenient mode of \nproduction system that varies with their form and shape. They can be either a natural \nwater system like lagoon or lake or an artificial one (Jim\u00e9nez et\u00a0al. 2003; Nayak \net\u00a0al. 2016). Different types of open pond systems used widely in the large-scale \nmicroalgae production include shallow big pond, closed pond, raceway pond, and \ncircular pond tank (Harun et\u00a0al. 2010; Apel et\u00a0al. 2017). The highly preferred artifi-\ncial pond system is raceway pond (Jim\u00e9nez et\u00a0al. 2003; Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al. 2013; De \nAndrade et\u00a0al. 2016). It is an earth-lined compact concrete system with an oval- \nshaped, closed-loop recirculation channel (0.2\u20130.5\u00a0m depth). A paddle wheel will \nbe introduced to provide a continuous cycle of production for the stabilization of \ngrowth and its productivity (Fig.\u00a0 4.2). The submerged aerator and surface air in turn \nwill provide the sufficient CO 2 for the microalgal growth. The output in the biomass \nyield highly depends on the location of the pond system (Masojidek and Torzillo \n2008; Chisti 2016). The growth-limiting factors in the open pond system include \npH, DO concentration, culture contamination, oxygen accumulation temperature, \nand intensity of the light source. The contamination in the open pond system is the \nother major issue in the mass production of microalgae. Certain microalgae can be \nonly cultivated in a specific condition, such as Chlorella in a high nutritious condi-\ntion, Spirulina in a high alkaline condition, Dunaliella in a high saline condition to \nprevent the cross-contamination from the open environment (Tafreshi and Shariati \n2006; Chiaramonti et\u00a0al. 2013). Recently, state estimators (software sensor) are used \nfor the accurate measurement of the biomass concentration in the outdoor cultiva-\ntion of microalgae in raceway photobioreactors (Garc\u00eda-Ma\u00f1as et\u00a0al. 2019). The \npond cultivation system is highly scalable and possesses less construction cost, \noperating cost, and maintenance cost (Apel and Botz 2015). The reactor configura-\ntions such as depth of the pond, temperature, mixing, light availability, CO 2 deliv-\nery, and gas transfer rate limit the productivity rate (Sutherland et\u00a0al. 2014; Zeng \net\u00a0al. 2016; Santos et\u00a0al. 2016a, b).\nJ.

Another study by Rastogi and co-workers gained insights into the\nmicrobial populations in sediments of a river polluted with signi\ufb01cant amounts of\ntoxic heavy metals (Rastogi et al. 2011 ). A combination of high-density 16S\nmicroarray (PhyloChip) and clone libraries speci\ufb01c to various functional groupsof bacteria captured several chemolithoautotrophic groups of bacteria, suggesting anoticeable metabolic diversity among the indigenous microbial populations. Prattand co-workers conducted a study that investigated the microbial communities inpolyaromatic-hydrocarbon-contaminated riverbank sediments using phospholipid-derived fatty acid analysis (PLFA) (Pratt et al. 2012 ). The authors found that the\nsubsurface sediments displayed highest proportions of PLFA biomarkers speci\ufb01c to\nanaerobic, heterotrophic bacteria, especially sulfate reducers, whereasmethanotrophs were abundant in surface sediments. Another study undertakenrecently by Hamonts and co-workers looked into the microbial community struc-ture in eutrophic sediments of the Zenne River located in Vilvoorde, Belgium(Hamonts et al. 2014 ). These sediments were also contaminated with chlorinated\naliphatic hydrocarbons (CAH) discharged into the riverbed from groundwaterbase\ufb02ow. A combined PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) anal-\nysis revealed that the dominant members were CAH-respiring Dehalococcoides\nand other functional groups such as methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Theauthors also observed that organic carbon content and CAH content were signi\ufb01cantfactors in\ufb02uencing the variance in community composition.\nFreshwater lake ecosystems are presumably more vulnerable to different aquatic\ncontaminants partly due to local pollution events from anthropogenic sources.Among other inland waters, lakes play a key role in global carbon budget andserve as sentinels indicating environmental changes through differential rates of\ncarbon processing (Williamson et al. 2008 ). Needless to say, microbial activities\ngreatly impact metabolic responses in lake ecosystems. Additionally, certain lakesprovide special microhabitats supporting speci\ufb01c microbiota, e.g., variable organicmatter content in the neuston layer (the air-water interface) of high alpine lakes(H\u20acortnagl et al. 2010 ) and stable redox transition layers due to permanently\nstrati\ufb01ed water columns in meromictic lakes (Casamayor et al. 2008 ). In a nutshell,\nlake ecosystems can potentially harbor highly diverse microbial populations, andmulti-lake studies have demonstrated that the difference in bacterial community\ncomposition between lakes can be quite large (Newton et al. 2011 ).\nEffects of mercury contamination on the microbial communities in a eutrophic\nlake along spatiotemporal scale were investigated by Macalady et al. ( 2000 ).\nAlthough mercury methylation and organic carbon content in the sediment wereprimary factors in\ufb02uencing community composition, PLFA analysis revealed dom-inance of sulfate-reducing genera such as Desulfobacter and Desulfovibrio ,\nsuggesting signi\ufb01cant roles of this functional group in mercury methylation.Gough and co-workers studied the microbial communities in anoxic sediments of\nLake DePue, located in Illinois, USA, with a prolonged exposure history to heavy\nmetals (Gough and Stahl 2011 ).

[CrossRef] [PubMed]\n\nDocument 3072: HAN  et al:  ANTI-CANCER EFFECTS OF FUCOIDAN IN HT29 CELLS 3451\nDiscussion\nGiven the high mortality rate as a result of colon cancer and \nthe significant morbidity, apparent toxicity and poor response \nrates of current chemotherapeutic regimens, there has been a \nbig push to identify novel therapeutic modalities with fewer \ntoxicity profiles. The PI3K \/Akt\/mTOR signaling axis is critical \nin the proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis  and \nmetastasis, and is central to the development and maintenance  \nof colorectal cancer cells (21 -23). Accordingly, inhibition of \nthe activity and expression of the Akt pathway may lead to \nthe development of effective therapy in patients with colon \ncancer. Although numerous studies have made great efforts \nto develop potential anti -cancer agents inhibiting the Akt \npathway, the majority of clinical trials remain to be success -\nfully completed  (24).\nIn search of efficacious tumor suppressors, a wide variety of \nnatural products and the pharmacologically active components \nof plants are  promising candidates. These natural products \nhave several advantages over synthetic chemicals with regards \nto side effects and pharmacophore diversity. Certain products \nfrom various natural resources have previously been charac -\nterized as potential therapeutics with anti -cancer activity (22). \nAmong them, fucoidan has been demonstrated to possess \nanti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on MCF -7 breast \ncancer cells; however, not on human mammary epithelial \ncells (23). Previously, fucoidan was demonstrated to inhibit \nmetastasis by suppressing  MMP -2\/29 and reducing the expres -\nsion and secretion of a vascular endothelial growth factor (14). \nHowever, the underlying mechanism of its inhibition of cancer \ncell proliferation and metastasis remains to be elucidated. The \npresent study partly identified, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the underlying molecular mechanism of the \nanti-proliferative and anti -metastatic effects of fucoidan.\nCell viability was assessed using an MTT assay in the \nabsence or presence of various concentrations of fucoidan. \nFucoidan inhibited cell growth, the expression of MMP -2 and \ncell migration capacity at 200 \u00b5g\/ml. Therefore, the anti -prolif -\nerative and anti -migratory effects of fucoidan observed in the \npresent study were dependent on its cancer -preventive effects.\nThe Akt signaling pathway is known to regulate the devel -\nopment and progression of various types of tumor (24 -26). \nThere is an accumulating number of studies demonstrating \nthe importance of the Akt signaling pathway in the inhibi -\ntion of cell growth (24 -27). Previous studies have revealed \na decreased activation of Akt in growth -retarded tumor \ncells (24 -27). Several previous studies have also demon -\nstrated  that targeting of the PI3K \/Akt signaling pathway \nwith anti -sense small interfering (si)RNA or small molecule \ninhibitors results in the downregulation of tumor invasion and \ntumorigenesis in malignant cancer cells (28,29). The results \nof the present study demonstrated that fucoidan inhibited the \nphosphorylation of PI3K \/Akt in a time - and dose -dependent \nmanner. PI3K and Akt are well -known upstream regulators \nof the mTOR signaling pathway in mammalian cells. As \nevidence of this hypothesis, siRNA -mediated gene silencing \nof PI3K and Akt inhibited the activation of p70S6K1, a \ndownstream target of mTOR, and subsequently led to the \nsuppression of migration, invasion and proliferation  (30). \nIn the present study, fucoidan significantly  decreased the \nphosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K1. In addition, since \nprevious studies indicated  that spheroid cells were more \nresistant to chemotherapeutic drugs (31 -34), the present study\n\nDocument 5259: Mar.

During the washing step for Pyropia  processing, these \npathogens proliferate rapidly, significantly reducing the quality of the final product . To develop non-acidic treatments \nfor these pathogens, various calcium salts were tested against the infectivity of P . porphyrae and  Olpidiopsis pyropiae  on \nPyropia gametophytes, and calcium propionate was the most effective. When Pyropia blades were immersed in 10 mM \ncalcium propionate for 1 h after inoculation with the oomycete pathogen, infection rate of both oomycete pathogens on \nday 2 was significantly lower (7.1 %) than control (>95 %). Brief incubation of Pyropia  blades in calcium propionate also \nreduced the spread of infection. The infected area of Pyropia  thallus was reduced to 14.3 % of the control in 2 days after \ntreatment with 100 mM calcium propionate for 30 s. In field experiments conducted in actual aquaculture farms, it has \nbeen shown that a brief 30 s wash every two weeks with 100 mM calcium propionate can effectively reduce the spread of \noomycetes throughout the entire culture period. The above results suggest that calcium propionate can be a useful means \nfor controlling the spread of oomycetes not only during laver processing but also during aquaculture.\nKeywords:  calcium propionate; Olpidiopsis pyropiae ; oomycete; Pyropia ; Pythium porphyrae\nINTRODUCTION\nThe global production of cultivated macroalgae more \nthan doubles every decade, and the production of red \nalgae has overtaken brown algae since 2010, dominating \nthe market (Badis et al. 2020 b). Production of laver ( Pyro -\npia spp., formerly known as Porphyra ) (Zuccarello et al. \n2022) has also doubled during the same period, primar -\nily due to a rapid expansion in China and Korea, but this \nrapid development of aquaculture is followed by a simi -\nlarly increasing economic burden of disease outbreaks \n(Cottier-Cook et al. 2016, 2021). Disease management is a growing concern for Pyropia  farmers, and now con -\ntributes up to half the running cost of a farm (Kim et al. \n2014). Infected Pyropia  are still harvested and used, but \ncrop yield and quality are severely reduced (Klochkova et \nal. 2017), and market prices may drop by up to one-third \nof non-infected crops. Infection continues to spread after \nharvest. The harvested thallus is washed alternately with \nseawater and fresh water over 2\u20133 days to remove con -\ntaminants, and then goes through a drying process. Dur -\ning this time, the infection spreads further and the dead \nReceived  February 2, 2023,  Accepted  March 8, 2023\n*Corresponding Author\nE-mail: ghkim@kongju.ac.kr\nTel: +82-41-850-8504,   Fax: +82-41-850-8504This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms \nof the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial \nLicense (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/3.0\/) which permits \nunrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nDocument 3740: Kim et al.   Oomycete Pathogen Control in Pyropia  Using Calcium Propionate77\nhttp:\/\/e-algae.orgFisheries show that on average, 10 % of the annual Pyro -\npia production is lost due to pathogens (Klochkova et al. \n2012, Cottier-Cook et al. 2021). Yield and value losses due \nto Olpidiopsis -blight and red rot disease have been re -\nported as high as 15\u201320 and 20\u201330 %, respectively (Park et \nal. 2000), and losses due to oomycete diseases have been \nreported as high as 77.5 % in the past (1983\u20131985) (Cho \nand Chang 1986). Our three-year investigation in Pyro -\npia farms showed that currently used acid-wash meth -\nods cannot effectively control the infection and spread of \noomycetes, especially Olpidiopsis  spp. (Kim et al. 2014). \nMoreover, the transportation and manufacturing pro -\ncesses of Pyropia harvested from farms does not allow for \nthe use of acid treatment. \nGovernment regulations for disease control in South \nKorea\u2019s seaweed farms are very strict. Chemical treat -\nments are currently limited to a few organic acids or \nconcentrated salts that have been approved through gov -\nernment review and testing in the field (Kim et al. 2014). \nFarmers also try to avoid chemical treatments as much \nas possible to reduce operating costs. Pyropia cultivation \ntakes place between October and March, when the water \ntemperature is relatively low in part because the spread \nof disease is slower during this time. If there is a concern \nthat the water temperature will not drop low enough to \nprevent the spread of infection other methods can be \nemployed. The freezing net method is sometimes used, \nin which nets are stored at -20\u00b0C and then reinstalled in \nthe field at the appropriate time (e.g., Fujita and Migita \n1980, Ding and Ma 2005, Klochkova et al. 2012), but this \nreduces growth time and is expensive to implement. In \nsome areas, farmers expose aquaculture nets to the air for \nseveral hours during the day, taking advantage of the fact \nthat Pyropia  thalli are more resistant to cold and desic -\ncation than other organisms (Klochkova et al. 2012). The \nmost common method is acid-washing, which is not ef -\nfective in preventing the spread of infectious disease (Kim \net al. 2014). Despite all these attempts, oomycete patho -\ngens are still the biggest problem for Pyropia  farms. This \nstudy shows that calcium propionate salts are very use -\nful in controlling oomycete pathogens, although govern -\nment regulations need to be modified before this method \ncan be used more broadly. However, calcium propionate \ntreatment can be a useful means of effectively preventing \nthe spread of infection during the transportation and pro -\ncessing step of harvested Pyropia, even without legisla -\ntive changes.\nCalcium salt treatments are widely used to eliminate \noomycetes that cause root \/ fruit rot in many important \ncrops including citrus, soybeans, potatoes, onions, and Table 2.

The band at 1377 cm\u22121 was attributed to the symmetric bending of protonated amino groups (NH 3+) in non-acetylated residues, while the two bands at 1321 and 1415 cm\u22121 were attributed to methyl C-H bending of acetyl groups. As for the nanoparticles, they have rounder shapes with sizes below 200 nm. Smaller nanoparticles around 200\u2013300 nm could only be obtained when nanoparticle composition was dominated by fucoidan. This could be due to the much lower molecular weight of FFv (44.7 kDa) when compared to that of CS (439 kDa). Smaller sizes are usually preferred as they ensure better contact with cellular structures.","reference_context":"Document 3414: Mar. Drugs 2023 ,21, 115 6 of 22\nMar.

The above results thus confirm the proximal composition detailed \nin Table 1. \nThe CS spectrum shows bands at 1650 and 1560 cm\u22121, which are the amide I and \namide II bands of the N-acetyl groups in acetylated mono mers. The highest intensity of \nthe former may be due to some contribution  of adsorbed water molecules. The band at \n1377 cm\u22121 was attributed to the symmetric bend ing of protonated amino groups (NH 3+) \nin non-acetylated residues, while the two bands at 1321 and 1415 cm\u22121 were attributed to \nmethyl C-H bending of acetyl groups. Finally, the broad band at 1020 cm\u22121 could be as-\nsociated with the glyc osidic linkage [27]. \nThe formulation of the NP using CS and FFv at a 2\/1 ratio ( w\/w) was also character-\nized. The corresponding spectrum showed a band associated with the sulphate ester group (S=O stretching) from FFv and a band attributed to methyl C-H bending of acetyl \ngroups from CS. The C=O of FFV is now masked by the broad 1650 \u22121560 cm\n\u22121 band of \nCS. The latter absorption is now the most inte nse, which seems to corroborate the attrib-\nution of the 1640 cm\u22121 band to adsorbed water; an effective drying of the formulation \nwould eliminate part of this water. Furthe r, during the polyelectrolyte complexation, \nsolvation water molecules are expelled from th e coacervate, thus reducing the amount of \nadsorbed water in the formulation relative to the free polyelectrolytes. The band, cen-\ntered at 1020 cm\u22121 and associated with the glycosidic li nkage, also reflects the presence of \nboth polymers, since it is as broad as that of  CS, but not as round-shaped; instead, it pre-\nsents a sharper shape, similar to the one of FFv. Lastly, the band attributed to the proto-\nnated amino groups of CS shifted to 1411 cm\u22121 and became broader, now masking the C-\nH bendings of acetyl groups. This may be as cribed to the electrostatic binding of such \ngroups and the sulphates of FFv. These obse rvations were expected, demonstrating the \ncomplexation between the polymers, ultimately resulting in the polymeric nanoparticles. \nOther authors formulating nanoparticles based on the polymers focused herein observed similar performances [19,28]. \n2.1.4.

The first peak is possibly related to the loss of water associated \nwith the polymer, whilst the second is a highly exothermic peak, which is suggested to be related to the polymer degradation during the heating process. Both peaks are coinci-\ndent with reports in the literature [29], sugge sting an amorphous state. The diagram cor-\nresponding to CS (Figure 4b) is similar to that of FFv regarding the presence of a peak at-tributable to the loss of water around 118 \u00b0C and an exothermal peak at 320 \u00b0C indicat-\ning the degradation of CS amine groups, as reported in the literature [30], again suggest-\ning an amorphous state. As for the nanoparticle formulation of FFv\/CS = 2\/1 ( w\/w), two \npeaks are shown at around 117 \u00b0C and 195 \u00b0C.

The\ncomplete physicochemical characterisation is displayed in Figure 8.\nThe most relevant observation is the fact that smaller nanoparticles around 200\u2013300 nm\ncould only be obtained when nanoparticle composition was dominated by fucoidan (mass\nratios of 4\/1 to 2\/1 in FFv\/CS nanoparticles and 1\/3 to 1\/4 in CS\/FFv nanoparticles). This\ncould be ascribed to the much lower molecular weight of FFv (44.7 kDa) when compared\nto that of CS (439 kDa). Still, in the referred conditions, smaller sizes were obtained when\nFFv was the dominant polymer in the ratio tested (FFv\/CS or CS\/FFv nanoparticles afore-\nmentioned, p< 0.05), a behaviour also observed in other studies reporting the formulation\nof fucoidan\/chitosan nanoparticles [ 28,36]. When the same mass of both polymers was\nused (mass ratio of 1\/1), it was interesting to observe that the size was, in all cases, around\n550\u2013600 nm. Beyond that, when the CS amount increased compared with that point, the\nsize of nanoparticles increased steadily to reach more than 600\u2013800 nm, which limits the\ninterest of the systems, as smaller sizes ensure better contact with cellular structures and are\nusually preferred. Moreover, the size decrease is certainly a consequence of the interaction\npromoted by the sulphate groups, meaning that, when more sulphate groups are available\nfor the interaction, smaller sizes are expected for the polymeric nanoparticles. On the other\nhand, when CS is in higher amounts in comparison with FFv, the behaviour is the opposite,\nand increased sizes are observed. In this case, due to CS polymer chains and a single\npositive charge by the CS monomer [ 37], larger polyelectrolyte complexes are synthesised\ndue to the scarcity of negative charges in these formulations [ 38]. It was noticeable that\nthe whole variation in nanoparticle size was more limited in CS\/FFv nanoparticles (size\nwithin 320 and 760 nm, Figure 8c,d) than in FFv\/CS nanoparticles, where size increased\nfrom 236 to 1448 nm ( p< 0.05).

The bioactive properties of fucoidan preparations have been assessed in a range of in vitro\nand animal models [ 5] and include demonstrated antimicrobial [ 6], antiviral [ 7] and anticancer [ 8]\ne\ufb00ects.

The potential for intense physical activity to induce\nalterations in immune function, including markers of mucosal immunity, and increase risk for upper\nrespiratory symptoms has been of interest for several decades [ 13,14]. Assessment of mucosal immune\ncompetence in athletes has typically utilized saliva samples and included assessment of both innate\n(e.g., lactoferrin and lysozyme) and adaptive (e.g., secretory immunoglobulin A; sIgA) markers and\nis considered relevant to protective mechanisms in the upper respiratory tract. Indeed, associations\nbetween low mucosal (tear) lysozyme concentrations [ 15] and salivary IgA [ 16,17] and risk for upper\nrespiratory tract infection are reported in the literature.

In fact, fucoidans have been \napproved to be produced as food in China in 2019. Biologically, they \nhave been found to have many beneficial effects such as antiviral, anti- \ninflammatory, anticancer, antithrombosis (Wang et al., 2017 ), and \nimmunomodulatory activities with low side effects (Zha et al., 2018 ). \nIncreasing the activity of the immune system is a significant bio-\nlogical function of fucoidans through either improved release of pro- \ninflammatory mediators or decreased anti-inflammatory response \n(Bahramzadeh, Tabarsa, You, Li, & Bita, 2019 ). The multifunctionality \nof fucoidan is highly variable, and greatly dependent upon its complex \nmolecular structure. Therefore, it is commonly believed that the \nmagnitude of immunomodulatory activities of fucoidans is dominated \nby compositional characteristics such as monosaccharide composition, \nmolecular weight, and sulfate content (Borazjani, Tabarsa, You, & \nRezaei, 2018 ). Structurally, fucoidans are highly branched hetero -\npolysaccharides, and these structures vary within species, season, har-\nvest location and maturity of the plant (Fletcher, Biller, Ross, & Adams, \n2017 ). Therefore, considering the complexity of fucoidan structures and \ntheir multiple functional abilities, significant potential exists to explore \nnew seaweed sources in order to acquire natural polysaccharides with \nimproved health benefits and biological activities. \nSargassum species are present throughout subtropical and tropical \nareas globally and have been shown to produce many structural classes \nof metabolites such as sulfated polysaccharides, glycerides, polyphenols, \nand terpenoids, etc., which possess many therapeutic activities (Yende, \nHarle, & Chaugule, 2014 ). Therefore, Sargassum species have great po-\ntential in the neutralceutical field, and have been identified as a key \nmedicinal food of the twenty-first century. Sargassum Zhangii fucoidan \n(SZF) is an relatively unexplored compound; although it has been re-\nported to have cholesterol-lowering activity (Lin, Chen, & Zhong, 2022 ), \nlittle research has been conducted into its immunomodulatory activities. \nMotivated by this, the objective in this study was to determine the \nimmune cell stimulating activities of SZF, and characterize its physi -\nochemical and structural properties through a number of approaches \nincluding ion chromatograph, high performance gel-permeation chro-\nmatography, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and \nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), etc. The immunoregulatory activ-\nities of the fucoidans on RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were determined \nby the production of nitric oxide (NO), a key component of the immu -\nnomodulatory pathway and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the \ninducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) \nimmune cytokines, were also determined based on protein abundance \nand gene expression. The results show that SZF exhibit previously un-\nreported immune stimulating activities. These results, taken together, \nidentify SZF as an outstanding candidate for further development in the \nfunctional or nutraceutical food fields. \nMaterials and methods \nChemical suppliers \nFucoidan Fuc1 (Undaria pinnatifida source, batch# 572001015) was \nobtained from Qingdao bright moon seaweed group co., LTD.

Several previous reports have demon-\nstrated the anti-in\ufb02ammatory activities of fucoidan and fucoidan-containing extracts in\ndifferent experimental models in vitro and in vivo [2,3,21,22]. One of the previous in vivo\nstudies from our research group revealed that dietary fucoidan extracts from Undaria pin-\nnati\ufb01da and Fucus vesiculosus were highly effective in ameliorating dextran sulfate sodium\n(DSS)-induced colitis in mice through a consistent downregulation of a signi\ufb01cant number\nof pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines, including TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-6 [ 14]. It is now generally\nrecognized that the in\ufb02ammatory response in patients and animal models of in\ufb02ammatory\nbowel disease (IBD) is primarily macrophage driven [ 14,21\u201323]. In the event of intestinal\nin\ufb02ammation, monocytes are recruited and differentiated into macrophages within the\nlamina propria [ 14,22]. It is considered that the initial exposure of interstitial macrophages\nto bacterial antigens is responsible for the activation of macrophages and that, at least in\nthe DSS model, these activated macrophages subsequently stimulate the proliferation of\nT cells [ 14]. Macrophages play a crucial role in stimulating and modulating the immune\nresponse (14). Furthermore, they regulate the function of adaptive immunity through\ncell-to-cell interaction or \ufb02uid-phase modulation via chemokines and cytokines [ 24]. The\nbiological activities of macrophages, including phagocytosis, migration, and cytokine\nsecretion, are critical to the immune response outcome [25].\nFollowing on from our previous in vivo \ufb01ndings on a colitis model using fucoidan\nfrom Undaria pinnati\ufb01da and a fucoidan-polyphenol extract from Fucus vesiculosus [14], this\npresent study investigates the effect of multiple fucoidan extracts on lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) induced whole human PBMC and THP-1 monocyte cell lines on pro-in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokine production. Fucoidan from \ufb01ve different sources has been used in the current in-\nvestigation, including Undaria pinnati\ufb01da (UPF), Fucus vesiculosus (FVF), Macrocystis pyrifera\n(MPF), Ascophyllum nodosum (ANF), and Laminaria japonica (LJF). Extracts from UPF, FVF,\nand MPF were further depyrogenated and\/or fractionated to yield depyrogenated (DP)\nand low molecular weight fucoidan extracts (LMWF). The source, purity, and molecular\nweight for each extract are described in Table 1. Here, we aimed to compare the anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory effects of these extracts with a primary focus on major pro-in\ufb02ammatory\nmarkers, including TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-6 and assess the dose-dependent inhibition of\nthese cytokines after pre-treatment with fucoidan extracts. Additionally, we also sought to\ninvestigate the cytotoxic effects of these fucoidan extracts in our experimental model.\nTable 1.

Thus, extensive efforts have\nbeen directed to the discovery of drugs that exhibit p53-independent action. In the current study,\nwe investigated the role of p53 in the antiproliferative activity induced by fucoidan on two p53\nisogenic HCT116 cell lines. The results obtained in the present study showed that treatment with\nfucoidan similarly reduced the cell viability of p53+\/+ and p53 \u2212\/\u2212HCT116 cell lines (Figure 1),\nwhich was related with apoptosis induction that was characterized by chromatin condensation, DNA\nfragmentation, sub-G1 phase cell accumulation, and PARP cleavage (Figures 2\u20134). The observed\napoptotic induction in both HCT116 cell lines obviously resulted from DNA damage, as re\ufb02ected by\nthe increased phosphorylation of \u03b3H2AX, a double-stranded DNA breakage marker (Figure 4). These\ndata collectively suggest that the proliferation-inhibitory effect of fucoidan is related with apoptosis\ninduction and DNA damage, and this event was independent of p53 expression in HCT116 cells.\nIn addition to apoptosis, inhibition of cell cycle progression is an important strategy to control\ncancer cell growth, and the induction of cell cycle arrest by chemopreventive agents could be an\n\nDocument 4150: p27, on the other hand, inhibits cell cycle progression. \nTherefore, decreased expression  of p27 may contribute to \ncell proliferation [16,17].

Cell Viability Assay\nAn experiment was conducted on HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells categorized into\ntwo groups to con\ufb01rm the cancer cell treatment ability of PpIX (5-ALA), Ce6, and CFN-gel\nitself and the PDT effect in the cell state. In one group, only 5-ALA, Ce6, and CFN-gel\nwere treated, and in the other group, PDT was performed after 5-ALA, Ce6, and CFN-gel\ntreatment. First, HCT 116 cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7104\ncells\/well and incubated for 24 h to allow cell attachment. The non-PDT group was treated\nwith 5-ALA (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 \u00b5M), Ce6 (0, 1, 2, and 5 \u00b5M), and CFN-gel (0, 1, 2, and 5 \u00b5M\nCe6 equivalent) for 6 h. The PDT group was treated with 5-ALA (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 \u00b5M),\nCe6 (0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 \u00b5M), and CFN-gel (0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 \u00b5M Ce6 equivalent) for 6 h, after\nwhich a fresh cell culture medium was added. At this stage, the PDT group underwent\nPDT with a 660 nm CW laser at 9 J\/cm2(an irradiation dose rate of 50 mW\/cm2). After\nincubating the cells for 24 h, cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8\n(CK04-11, Dojindo, Japan).\n2.6. In Vivo NIR Fluorescence Imaging\nIn this experiment, 7-week-old male BALB\/c nude mice were used. All experiments\nwere conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee of Dankook University (DKU-21-072). For in vivo experiments, HCT 116\ncells were subcutaneously transplanted into four BALB\/c nude mice and grown until\nthe tumors reached ~200 mm3in size. To acquire real-time \ufb02uorescence images, each\nmouse was injected with PBS (100 \u00b5L), 5-ALA (250 mg\/kg), Ce6 (5 mg\/kg), and CFN-gel\n(5 mg Ce6 equivalent\/kg), and \ufb02uorescence images were acquired using the proposed\nsystem. The light source for \ufb02uorescence imaging was 405 nm for mice injected with\n5-ALA and 650 nm for mice injected with Ce6 and CFN-gel (an irradiation dose rate of\n20 mW\/cm2). Fluorescence images were acquired 4, 6, 9, and 24 hours after injecting 5-ALA,\nCe6, and CFN-gel, respectively. After 24 h, the mice were sacri\ufb01ced, and the cancers and\norgans were extracted to con\ufb01rm the remaining PpIX (5-ALA), Ce6, and CFN-gel through\n\ufb02uorescence imaging. Lymph nodes were extracted to con\ufb01rm the metastasis of colorectal\ncancer through \ufb02uorescence imaging using the proposed system and H&E staining.\n2.7. In Vivo PDT\nFor PDT performance using the proposed system, BALB\/c nude mice (Orientbio Inc.,\nRepublic of Korea) were divided into \ufb01ve groups: group 1 (control, no injection), group\n2 (PBS), group 3 (5-ALA), group 4 (Ce6), and group 5 (CFN-gel). After injecting the HCT\n116 cancer cell line into each group, tumors were grown to 100\u2013200 mm3in size. PBS\n(100\u00b5L), 5-ALA (250 mg\/kg), Ce6 (5 mg\/kg), and CFN-gel (5 mg Ce6 equivalent\/kg) were\nintravenously injected into the mouse models. After 24 h, the light source was changed to a\n660 nm wavelength for PDT through the switch of the proposed system, and an energy of\napproximately 18 J\/cm2(irradiation for 6 min with an optical power of 50 mW\/cm2) was\napplied to each of the tumors in groups 2\u20135. PDT was performed only once a day after the\ninjection of 5-ALA, Ce6, and CFN-gel, and the tumor volume was observed for 12 days to\ncompare the groups.\n3. Results\n3.1.

Over time, cancer cell accumula tion was observed by injecting commercially \navailable 5-ALA, Ce6, and CFN-gel. In  this study, the proposed near-infrared \nfluorescence diagnostic\u2013therapy  system was used to observe the accumulation of PpIX \n(5-ALA), Ce6, and CFN-gel in cancer, and a filter and light source appropriate for the absorption and excitation wavelengths of PpIX (5-ALA), Ce6, and CFN-gel were used. \nUnlike the cancer cell experiment, in the case of the in vivo experiment, the fluorescence \nefficiency was lower than that of the cell ex periment because the mouse skin tissue had to \nbe irradiated with light. Over time, 5-ALA has been shown to be eliminated from the \nbody rather than significantly accumulating at tumor sites. In Figure 5B, it can be seen that strong fluorescence is emitted throughout the body at 4, 6, and 9 h in mice injected \nwith 5-ALA. This is not the fluorescence fr om PpIX accumulated in the cancer but the \nautofluorescence from PpIX present on the skin surface. Similar to the results of the \ncancer cell experiment, it was found that Ce 6 accumulated better in the cancerous region \nof xenograft mice than 5-ALA did. However,  almost no fluorescence was observed after \nFigure 4. In vitro cell viability on HCT 116 cells treated with various 5-ALA, Ce6, and CFN-gel\nconcentrations.

The size, shape, and \nposition of apical pore plate (Po) and plates 1', 2', 4', 6\", 7\", \nand 3\"' are traits used for species differentiation.

Additional morphometric and tabular character -\nistics used to differentiate C. malayensis  from C. monotis  \nare cell size, plate 3' shape, and Po length (Mohammad-\nNoor et al. 2013). C. malayensis  is generally smaller than \nC. monotis (Leaw et al. 2016), although there is some size \nrange overlap, and C. malayensis  is usually narrower.

All Coolia  species except C. monotis , C. areolata , and \nC. santacroce have been observed in the Pacific Ocean, \nparticularly in the west (Faust 1995, Holmes et al. 1995, \nFraga et al. 2008, Leaw et al. 2010, Mohammad-Noor et \nal. 2013, Momigliano et al. 2013, Rhodes et al. 2014 b, \nKarafas et al. 2015, Larsson et al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2020). \nC. canariensis  and C. monotis  have been reported in the \neastern and western Atlantic (Penna et al. 2005, Fraga \net al. 2008, Laza-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2011, David et al. 2014, \nLeaw et al. 2016, Lewis et al. 2018, Mendes et al. 2019, \nNascimento et al. 2019), while records of C. malayensis , \nC. palmyrensis , C. santacroce , and C. tropicalis have been \nrestricted to the western Atlantic (Faust 1995, Karafas \net al. 2015, Leaw et al. 2016, Mendes et al. 2019, Nasci -\nmento et al. 2019, Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 et al. 2020) and C. guanchica  \nto the eastern Atlantic (David et al. 2019). C. areolata has \nonly been detected in the Southwest Indian Ocean (Ten-\nHage et al. 2000). In the Mediterranean Sea, C. monotis \nis widely dispersed from the western (Halim 1960, Vila et \nal. 2001, Penna et al. 2005) to the eastern basin (Aligizaki \nand Nikolaidis 2006, Armi et al. 2010, Ismael 2014, Ben-\nGharbia et al. 2016, Abdennadher et al. 2020).Fraga et al. 2008, Leaw et al. 2010, Karafas et al. 2015, Da -\nvid et al. 2019). However, the presence of morphologi -\ncally cryptic species, as is the case of C. monotis  species \ncomplex (Leaw et al. 2010, 2016, Momigliano et al. 2013, \nKarafas et al. 2015) creates misidentification. Therefore, a \nmolecular phylogenetic approach is often used to com -\nplement morphology. At present, molecular data is avail -\nable for all Coolia species (Penna et al. 2005, Fraga et al. \n2008, Leaw et al. 2010, Momigliano et al. 2013, Karafas et \nal. 2015) except for C. areolata . Different ribosomal DNA \n(rDNA) gene markers have been used to support species \ndelineation namely the large subunit (LSU) (Dolapsakis \net al. 2006, Fraga et al. 2008, Leaw et al. 2010, Karafas et \nal. 2015, Ben-Gharbia et al. 2016, G\u00f3mez et al. 2016, Da -\nvid et al. 2019, Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020), the \n5.8S and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) (Penna et \nal. 2005, Leaw et al. 2010, David et al. 2014, 2019, Kara -\nfas et al. 2015, Nascimento et al. 2019, Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 et al. 2020, \nZhang et al. 2020) and the small subunit (Momigliano et \nal. 2013, Wakeman et al. 2015). The ITS2 secondary struc -\nture has also been documented to be useful in differen -\ntiating between Coolia  species (Leaw et al. 2010, 2016). \nSpecies of Coolia can live in diverse environments and \nFig. 1.

Another nutritional \nadjunctive therapy option is fucoidan. Fucoidan is a polysac -\ncharide derived from brown seaweed extracts. It is structurally \nsimilar to a heparin molecule; it consists of repeating units of \ndisaccharides containing an alpha -1, 3-linked fucose and an \nalpha -1, 4-linked fucose, forming an alpha -1, 3-backbone with \nbranches attached at C2 positions ( 18,19). Fucoidan is reported \nto possess antiviral, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticoagulant, \nanticancer\/antitumor, antiproliferative, and anti\u2011inflammatory \nproperties  (19,20). Treatment of atopic allergic reactions \nwith various fucoidan extracts improves allergic responses \nand prevents or reduces the symptoms of allergic disease by \nregulating the immune response, including an alteration in \nthe Th1\/Th2 balance, an inhibition of IgE production, and a \nsuppression of mast cells degranulation ( 21,22). In our previous \nstudy, we found that oligo -fucoidan might reduce the prolifera -\ntion of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells (23). However, the \neffects of oligo -fucoidan on T  cells during allergic disease \nremains unclear. In this study, peripheral blood mononuclear \ncells (PBMCs) from allergic asthmatic and non -asthmatic \nsubjects were cultured and T  cells were activated. We inves -\ntigated the effects of oligo -fucoidan on the profiles of the \nT cells and the levels of cytokines produced during allergic \ninflammation.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy subjects. The subjects were selected from outpatients \nat Kuang\u2011Tien General Hospital ( Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C.). \nThe inclusion criteria were ( 1) presence of allergic asthma, ( 2) \nabsence of complicated underlying disease, ( 3) lack of history \nof upper or lower airway disease during the month before the \nstudy, and ( 4) not having received immunotherapy or intravenous \nsteroids during the four weeks before the study (inhaled steroids \nwere allowed). The exclusion criteria were malignancy, infection, \npregnancy, or other systematic immune disease. These subjects \nwere collected from from March 2016 to June 2016. Thirty \npatients with allergic asthma (13 women and 17 men) and 15 \nhealthy subjects without allergic asthma (7 women and 8 men) \nwere included in this study. Pulmonary function was assessed by \nspirometry according to the standards of the American Thoracic \nSociety. All subjects were fully aware of the purpose and nature \nof the study, which was approved by Institutional Review Board \n(IRB) of Kuang\u2011Tien General Hospital.\nAsthma control test (ACT). The ACT is a simple test suitable for \nasthma patients (aged 12 years old and over) that helps patients \ndetermine their level of disease control in the past 4 weeks. \nThe test contains five questions; the lowest score is 1 and the \nhighest score is 5 for each item, A the lower score represents \nworse asthma control. The sum of the scores from the five ques -\ntions is calculated, with 25 as the maximum. A total score >19 \n(excluding 19) indicates asthma control is good; a total score is \n<19 indicates asthma control is poor ( 24).\nAnalysis of basic data and biochemical data of subjects. We \ncollected anthropometric data, including body weight and \nheight, and blood pressure from subjects using standardized techniques (IRB approved). Heparinized blood was collected \nto measure levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), \naspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen \n(BUN), and creatinine (Cre) in the hospital's inspection \ndepartment.

Discussion\nFucoidan is a water-soluble sulfate heteropolysaccharide with a wide range of bio-\nlogical activities. Fucoidan is most commonly isolated from marine brown algae, exhibits\neffective inhibitory and killing effects in the modi\ufb01cation of tumor cells, and is considered\nto be the next generation of natural anti-tumor drugs [ 28]. In this study, two fractions\nnamed F1 and F2 were obtained by puri\ufb01cation of crude fucoidan extracted in the early\nstage [ 29] using DEAE-cellulose-52. F1 (Mw 32,966 Da) and F2 (Mw 562,448 Da) were\ndegraded by Vc-H 2O2, and two degradation products named DF1 (14,893 Da) and DF2\n(21,292 Da) were obtained after CL-6B gel puri\ufb01cation. The physicochemical structure of\ninitial and degraded Sargassum fucoidan and their anti-tumor inhibitory activity against\nHepG2, A549, Hela and MCF-7 were evaluated.\nF1, F2 and DF1, DF2 had a similar FTIR pro\ufb01le, and all contain the characteristic\npeaks of functional groups of fucoidan. Additionally, the absorption peaks for S=O (1248\nand 1243 cm\u22121) of F2 and DF2 were signi\ufb01cantly enhanced, which is consistent with\nprevious results (Table 1). In addition, FTIR showed that the degradation treatment had\nno signi\ufb01cant change in the sulfation mode of polysaccharides, which was consistent with\nWang et al. [ 30]. Therefore, the structures of F1, F2 and DF1 and DF2 were similar, and the\nincreased antitumor activity of the degraded polysaccharides may be mainly attributed to\nthe content of polysaccharide, sulfate and L-fucose, as well as molecular weight.\nThe chemical composition of the four fractions showed that the contents of polysaccha-\nride and L-fucose in DF1 and DF2 increased compared with those before degradation, and\nsulfate remained stable or much higher than that before degradation, which is consistent\nwith the results of Li [ 31] and Wu [ 32] et al. Meanwhile, there was no obvious loss of\nsulfate and L-fucose during free radical degradation. In this study, the degraded fucoidan\nDF1 (Mw 14,893 Da) and DF2 (Mw 21,292Da) exhibited higher antitumor activity than\nbefore degradation. The contents of polysaccharide (42.82%), L-fucose (13.59%) and sulfate\n(18.06%) of F2 were higher than those of F1, but the molecular weight of F1 (Mw 32,966 Da)\nwas much smaller than that of F2 (Mw 562,448 Da), and the antitumor activity of F1 was\nhigher. Thus, the molecular weight was the most important factor affecting the activity\nunder this condition [ 33]. While the contents of polysaccharide (73.93%), L-fucose (23.02%)\nand sulfate (29.88%) of DF2 were higher than those of DF1, and the molecular weights of\nDF2 (Mw 21,292 Da) and DF1 (Mw 14,893 Da) were similar. Based on the previous study,\nthe sulfate and L-fucose contents were also an important determinant of the antitumor\nactivity [34].\nInitial and degraded fucoidans were found to have similar neutral monosaccharide\ncompositions, with fucose, mannose and rhamnose as the main components. The contents\nof glucose and galactose in the degraded fucoidan seemed to decrease, while the content of\nfucose increased. This result is consistent with what Zhao et al. have previously reported,\nthat oxidative degradation mainly acts on neutral sugars with low uronic acid and sulfate\ncontent, while it had little effect on the degradation of fucoidan with more sulfate radicals\nbound on the main chain [7].\nStudies have found that low molecular weight fucoidan mediates broad-spectrum\ngrowth inhibition of human cancer cells, including HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, HT1080\n\ufb01brosarcoma, K562 leukemia, U937 lymphoma, A549 lung adenocarcinoma and HL-60 [ 5].\nIn this study, the effects of four Sargassum fucoidan components before and after degra-\ndation on HepG2 (Figure 4A), A549 (Figure 4B), Hela (Figure 4C) and MCF-7 (Figure 4D)\ntumor cells were evaluated. Among them, the anti-tumor effects of degraded fucoidan\nwith low molecular weight (DF1 and DF2) were higher than those of natural fucoidan\n\nDocument 4903: Molecules 2023 ,28, 2610 12 of 14\n4.10. Statistical Analysis\nAll the experiments were repeated at least three times. Values were expressed as\nmeans\u00b1standard deviation (SD). Signi\ufb01cant difference between groups were determined\nusing One-Way ANOVA followed by LSD multiple comparison, and the differences were\nconsidered to be statistically signi\ufb01cant at p< 0.05. All analyses were conducted using the\nstatistical software, SPSS 26.0.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, four fucoidans (F1, F2, DF1 and DF2) were puri\ufb01ed and degraded from\ncrude fucoidans of Sargassum , physicochemically characterized, and tested for antitumor\nactivity in vitro . It was discovered that fucoidan\u2019s molecular weight reduced after degrada-\ntion even though its structure and chemical composition were different before and after\ndegradation. Under the same conditions, the inhibitory rate of the fucoidan DF2, which\nhad a lower molecular weight and the greatest concentration of polysaccharide, sulfate, and\nfucose, increased to 71.63% after 48 h. The IC 50of DF2 against HepG2, MCF-7, Hela, and\nA549 tumor cells was 2.2 mg\/mL, which was lower than the IC 50against other components.\nMoreover, Flow cytometry demonstrated that HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells might\nundergo apoptosis when exposed to fucoidan of Sargassum. Therefore, the antitumor\nactivity of Sargassum fucoidan was related to its L-fucose, sulfate content and molecular\nweight, with the most signi\ufb01cant inhibitory effect being on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma\ncells. These results suggest that Sargassum fucoidan has anti-hepatocarcinogenic poten-\ntial, but its potential conformational relationship and anti-tumor mechanism need to be\nfurther investigated.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, writing-original draft, B.L.; writing-review, Z.W.; project\nadministration, editing and funding acquisition, J.C.; investigation, methodology and software, X.C.\nand J.L.; supervision, formal analysis, conceptualization and resources, Y.L., R.L., X.L., B.S., K.-L.C.\nand S.Z.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Project of Science and Technology of Zhanjiang City (grant\nnumber: 2020A01034 and 2022A01045), Guangdong Basic and the Applied Basic Research Foundation\n(grant number: 2020A1515010860 and 2021A1515012455), the Guangdong Ocean University Innova-\ntion Program (grant number: 230419100), the Nanhai Youth Scholar Project of Guangdong Ocean\nUniversity (grant number: 002029002009), the Scienti\ufb01c Research Foundation of Guangdong Ocean\nUniversity (grant number: R17034), the Guangdong Province Ordinary Universities Characteristic\nInnovation Project (grant number: 2020KTSCX051), and the Guangdong Provincial Department of\nEducation and the Innovative Team Program of High Education of the Guangdong Province (grant\nnumber: 2021KCXTD021).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nCon\ufb02icts of Interest: The authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

Among the nine cell lines were two suspension cell lines (HL-60 (acute myeloid\nleukemia), Raji (Burkitt lymphoma)) and seven adherent cell lines [HeLa (cervix carcinoma), ARPE-19\n(human RPE), OMM-1 (uveal melanoma), A-375 (skin melanoma), HCT-116 (colon carcinoma), Hep\nG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HaCaT (keratinocytes)], thus including a total of seven tumor cell lines\n(HL-60, Raji, HeLa, OMM-1, A-375, HCT-116, Hep G2) and two non-cancerous cell lines (ARPE-19 and\nHaCaT). After incubation for 24 h with the di \ufb00erent fucoidans, the cell viability was measured using a\ncommercial MTS assay according to a standardized protocol. As reference compounds three di \ufb00erent\ncommercially available substances, namely reference heparin as well as reference enoxaparin (a LMWH)\nand the commercial Fucus vesiculosus fucoidan, were additionally tested. The tests were performed to\nobtain comparative information on the suitability of the di \ufb00erent fucoidans for further investigations.\n2. Results\nThe details of the extraction procedure of the six fucoidans as well as their basic characteristics\nnamely degree of sulfation (DS), molecular mass, monosaccharide composition, their contents of\npolyphenols, laminarin and protein as well as their radical-scavenging capacity, three exemplary\nbioactivities and their \ufb02uorescence intensity (FI) increasing e \ufb00ect on the sulfated glycan sensor\nPolymer-H are described elsewhere (unpublished data until accepted). To compare the e \ufb00ects of\nthe di \ufb00erent fucoidans and reference substances on cell viability, we determined their e \ufb00ects at\nconcentrations up to 100 \u00b5g\/mL (i.e., 0.07\u20130.53 \u00b5M fucoidans and 2.00 \u00b5M Sigma fucoidan, 7.69 \u00b5M\nheparin and 28.57 \u00b5M enoxaparin, whereby the molar concentrations can, however, only be very\nroughly estimated due to the polydispersity of these polysaccharides) on nine di \ufb00erent cell lines in\nrelation to the untreated control (100%) (Figure 1).\nIn the leukemic cell line HL-60, all test compounds apart from the DF fucoidan increased the cell\nviability (Figure 1a). The e \ufb00ects of FE and SL were signi\ufb01cant at all concentrations. FV , FS and LD\nincreased the cell viability signi\ufb01cantly at concentrations >1\u00b5g\/mL. Sigma fucoidan had stimulating\ne\ufb00ects at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/mL ( p<0.05), heparin only at 50 \u00b5g\/mL ( p<0.05) and the\nLMWH enoxaparin only at 100 \u00b5g\/mL ( p<0.001). A questionable exception was the signi\ufb01cant lower\ncell viability (77.7 \u00b111.0%, p<0.01) after treatment with 10 \u00b5g\/mL enoxaparin, whereas 100 \u00b5g\/mL\nincreased the cell viability signi\ufb01cantly ( p<0.001). The commercial fucoidan had a stimulating e \ufb00ect\nat 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/mL ( p<0.05).\nIn the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji, no inhibitory but rather a stimulatory e \ufb00ect was observed\n(Figure 1b). FV and FS fucoidans signi\ufb01cantly increased the cell viability at 10, 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/mL\nand FE only at 50 \u00b5g\/mL ( p<0.01). The other fucoidans and the reference substances showed no\nsigni\ufb01cant e \ufb00ect.\nThe cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa was one of the four cell lines, in which the compounds\npartly reduced the cell viability (Figure 1c).

Akram et al.\nFig. 2.4 Different types of biofuels that can be produced from processing of algae\n2.5.1 Production of Biodiesel\nBiodiesel is simply methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acid that is produced by the process\nof trans-esteri\ufb01 cation (in the presence of alcohols) of triglycerides. So we can say\nthat biodiesel is alkyl fatty acids (having chain length of C14 to C25), esteri \ufb01ed in\nthe presence of alcohols mostly CH 3OH or C 2H5OH. Biodiesel is most comparable\nwith the diesel from fossil fuels in characters like \ufb02ash point, \u201ccetane number \u201d,\nviscosity and heating value (Demirbas 2009 ). Due to these characters biodiesel\nseems to be the most demanding fuel in future because of limited resources fossil\nfuels. The other most demanding feature of biodiesel is its eco-friendly nature as it\nreduces emission of CO 2by 77% as compared to conventional fuels (Atadashi et al.\n2010 ) .\nItis\nthetype offuel thatcanbedegrade dbymicrobes (biod egradab le)and\nnon-t oxic thatisderiv edfrom renewable natural resour ces(Hossai netal.2008 ).It\nalsoenhances engine perfor mance aswellasreduces theemission ofsulfur andother\nparticula tematter during combu stion (MiaoandWu2006 ;Scragg etal.2002 ).For\ntheproduction ofbiodiesel, triglycerides aretransesteri \ufb01edbyacids oranycatalyst\nlikemetalstoproduce biodi eselandglycer olasby-pro duct (Chisti 20\n07;Johnso n\nandWen 2009).\nBykeepin ginview alltheabove ment ioned points biodie selsare\naccept ableinorder toful\ufb01ldemand offuel, butitscurren tproduct ionbyterrestr ial\nbioma ssisnotenough tomeet energy demands.

This is achieved by the\nhelp of methanogens (such as Methanosarcina barkeri ). After the production of\nbiogas, there would be enough nutrients as left over that can be utilized for further\nproduction of algal biomass (Ehimen et al. 2013 ).\n2.5.4 Bioethanol\nBioethanol\/ethyl alcohol is the type of ethanol that is obtained by processing of anynatural biological source. It could be utilized as replacement of petrol (Nahak et al.\n2013 ). Demand for bioethanol as a transportation fuel is increased with time. Many\ncountries like Brazil, China and India have started the production of bioethanol andusing it as fuel source (Lee and Lee 2016). Over conventional fuels which are\nobtained from fossil fuels, bioethanol is preferred because of its source and impactover environment. It has lower sulfur content than petrol that is why it emits less\ngreenhouse gases upon combustion. The scope for using bioethanol is high because\nit is renewable source. Bioethanol is produced after the break down of sugars and\nstarch which are obtained from \ufb01rst or second generation feedstock like lignocellu-\nlosic biomass, wheat bran corn, etc. (John et al. 2011 ). But continuous consumption\nof second generation feedstock would lead to depletion of food in the world which is\nalready a big issue of recent times. If they continue to use second generation\nfeedstock as a fuel source there would be debate about the water use, use of arable\nland and food versus fuel.\nThis p\nitfa\nll of using second generation feedstock is overcome by algae. Algae are\nthird generation renewable source and are the best substrate to produce Bioethanol.\nAlgae can grow on wastewater also either it is from municipal or industries.\nProduction of bioethanol by using algae would help in bioremediation because\nalgae use CO 2and other nutrients from wastewater for the process of \u201cphotosynthe-\nsis\u201dand resulting in treated water (John et al. 2011 ). Mainly it is obtained through\nthe process of fermentation of cellulose which is the main component of cell wall or\nby the starch that is a storage material (Ullah et al. 2015 ). Different species of algae\ncan store starch and other sugars which is stored by Chlorella vulgaris is 37% of the\ndry weight of its biomass. \u201cBlue green algae \u201dlike.\nChloroc ocum sp.\nandSpirogyra species can store high level of polysaccharide.\nCommonly used algal species (illustrated in Table 2.4) for the production of\nbioethanol are Prymnesium parvum ,Chlorella ,Scenedesmus ,Sargassum\nGracilaria ,Spirulina ,gracilis porphyridium ,Dunaliella and Chlamydomonas\n(Chaudhary et al. 2014 ) (Table 2.5).\n\nDocument 4745: tion process. Oil extracted from the algae is mixed with alcohol\nand an acid or a base to produce the fatty acid methylesters that\nmakes up the biodiesel [43].\nMany algae are exceedingly rich in oil, which can be converted\nto biodiesel. The oil content of some microalgae exceeds 80% of dry\nweight of algae biomass. The use of algae as energy crops has po-\ntential, due to their easy adaptability to growth conditions, the\npossibility of growing either in fresh- or marine waters and avoid-\ning the use of land. Furthermore, two thirds of earth\u2019s surface is\ncovered with water, thus algae would truly be renewable option\nof great potential for global energy needs.\n3.5. Biochemical processes\n3.5.1. Fermentation\nFermentation is used commercially on a large scale in variou-\nscountries to produce ethanol from sugar crops and starch crops.\nEthanol can be produced from a large variety of carbohydrates with\na general formula of (CH\n2O)n. Chemical reaction is composed of\nenzymatic hydrolysis of sucrose followed by fermentation of sim-\nple sugars. Fermentation of sucrose is performed using commercialyeast such as Saccharomyces ceveresiae . First, invertase enzyme in\nthe yeast catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to convert it into glu-\ncose and fructose.\nC12H22O11\nSucrose!C6H12O6\nGlucose\u00feC6H12O6\nFructose\u00f01\u00de\nSecond, zymase, another enzyme also present in the yeast, con-\nverts the glucose and the fructose into ethanol.\nC6H12O6!2C2H5OH\u00fe2CO 2 \u00f02\u00de\nGluco-amylase enzyme converts the starch into D-glucose. The\nenzymatic hydrolysis is then followed by fermentation, distillation\nand dehydration to yield anhydrous bioethanol. Corn (60\u201370%\nstarch) is the dominant feedstock in starch-to-bioethanol industry\nworldwide.\n3.5.1.1. Bioethanol. The algal biomass is ground, and the starch is\nconverted by enzymes to sugar. The sugar is converted to ethanol\nby yeast. Production of ethanol by using microalgal as raw material\ncan be performed according to the following procedure. In the \ufb01rst\nstep, the starch of microalgae is released from the cells with the aid\nof mechanical equipment or an enzyme.

B. Uzoejinwa et al.\n5.2 Biodiesel \nBiodiesel can be produced from algal lipids by transesteri\ufb01cation. First, algae are \nharvested and dried to reduce their moisture content, then lipids are extracted. The \nextraction can be done through various methods, including mechanical extraction, \nsolvent extraction, or enzymatic extraction. The extracted lipids are then converted \ninto biodiesel via a chemical reaction called transesteri\ufb01cation (Bello et al. 2012 ). \nThis reaction involves the reaction of lipids with alcohol, typically methanol, in the \npresence of a catalyst. The reaction produces fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) \n(Nisar et al. 2021 ), which are the main components of biodiesel and glycerol as a \nby-product. The biodiesel produced in the transesteri\ufb01cation reaction is then puri\ufb01ed \nto remove any residual solvent, water, and catalyst. The \ufb01nal product is tested for its \nquality, including its viscosity, \ufb02ash point, and fatty acid pro\ufb01le, to ensure it meets \nthe standards for biodiesel (Obiora 2022 ). Biodiesel production from algae, most \nespecially, the aquatic unicellular green algae (Chlorophyceae) is very economical \nand easy due to their high lipid content (Belousov et al. 2021 ). For example, \nAl-Humairi et al. ( 2022 ) employed a homogeneous base catalyst as a part of an \nintensi\ufb01ed process in direct and fast production of biodiesel from algae and obtained \na 97% yield of biodiesel in 10 min. The by-products of the biodiesel production from \nalgae include the lipid-free biomass and glycerol, which can be further used in many \napplications. Glycerol is a vital chemical compound with wide applications and can \nbe used for wounds treatment owing to its antimicrobial and antiviral characteristics, \npreparation of various pharmaceutical and medical products, preparation of several \npersonal care products, scenes \ufb01lming in the coastal region in \ufb01lm industries, used as \nsubstitute to water owing to its higher and more promising acoustic resistance, and as \na raw material in the production of nitroglycerin (Pirzadi and Meshkani 2022 ). Also, \nit showed high potential for cultivation of oleaginous fungi that can be used also for \nbiodiesel production (Li et al. 2022 ). The algal biomass which is free from lipids has \nsubstantial quantity of nutrients including carbohydrates, P, N, and other \nmicronutrients. Thus, the demand of the nutrients can be lowered by recycling the \nnutrients in the residual algal biomass (which is free from lipids) during algae \ncultivation (Abomohra et al. 2018 ). In addition, algal lipid-free biomass showed \nhigh antioxidant and radical scavenging activity (Abomohra et al. 2022 ). Apart from \nbeing a potential nutrient source, it can also serve as an alternative organic carbon \nsource (Kujawska et al. 2021 ).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":265,"situational_context":"A research assistant in marine biology is looking to understand the various ways of algae-based fuel production for an upcoming presentation.","topic":"Algae Biofuel Production"}}

After the cells adhered to\nthe plate matrix overnight, they were treated with varying doses of fucoidan (0.1 mg\/mL\nto 2.5 mg\/mL). The anti-cancer agent 5-\ufb02uorouracil (5-FU) in a concentration range of\n0.0064 \u00b5M to 2500 \u00b5M was included as a positive control for cytotoxicity. The experiments\nwere incubated for 72 h before treatment with resazurin. Cell viability was measured by\n\ufb02uorescence (excitation = 560 nm and emission = 590 nm).\n3.8. Clonogenic Assay\nHCT116 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 \u00d7103cells\/mL in a six-well plate\nand allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were treated with fucoidan extracts or 4-\nnitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), which was used as a positive control. The cultures were\nincubated at 37\u25e6C for 48 h, upon which half the volume of spent medium was removed\nand replaced with fresh medium lacking treatment. The cultures were incubated, and the\nmedium changed every two days until individual colonies of at least 50 cells\/colony were\nvisible. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS. The cells\nwere \ufb01xed for 10 min by a 3:1 methanol to the acetic acid mixture. The \ufb01xative was removed,\nand the plate was allowed to air dry for 2 min. The HCT116 cell colonies were stained with\n5% ( w\/v) crystal violet in methanol for 4\u20136 h, washed three times in PBS and rinsed in\nwater. The plates were air-dried, and the images were captured using a ChemiDoc\u2122-XRS\n(BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The cells were solubilised completely using 1 M acetic acid,\nand the absorbance was read at a wavelength of 590 nm. The % colony formation was\nexpressed as percentiles relative to the untreated experiments.\n3.9. Wound Healing Assay\nA volume of 500 \u00b5L\/well of HCT116 cells were seeded at 7 \u00d7105cells\/mL into 24 well\nplates. The cells were allowed to adhere and grow to 100% con\ufb02uence overnight at 37\u25e6C.\nA wound was made down the centre of the well with a pipette tip. After wounding, the\n\ufb02oating cells were removed, and fresh medium without or with varying doses of fucoidan\n(0.1\u20130.5 mg\/mL) treatments was added. Pre-migration images of the wounds were taken at\n4\u00d7magni\ufb01cation. The plates were further incubated at 37\u25e6C for 12 h, whereafter, images\nwere taken at the same position as the premigration images. The images were analysed on\nImageJ using a wound healing plugin [ 59], and wound closure was calculated using the\nformula below where the percentage wound area was calculated relative to the wound size\nat t = 0:\nWound closure =%wound area (t=0)\u2212%wound area (t=12)\n3.10. Sphere-Based Tumour Migration Assays\nHCT116 cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of Dulbecco\u2019s Modi\ufb01ed\nEagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) (\ufb01nal concentration of 1 \u00d7104cells\/10 \u00b5L) for the formation of\nspheres in an optimised hanging drop method [ 60]. About 5 mL of sterile PBS was pipetted\ninto the bottom portion of the tissue culture plate (100 mm diameter) to create a humidi\ufb01ed\nenvironment., Multiple 10 \u00b5L culture drops were deposited inside the lid of the culture\ndish. The lid with the hanging drops was placed back on top of the PBS-containing dish,\ntaking care to avoid disturbing the droplets. The plate was incubated for 48 h at 37\u25e6C to\nallow the spheres to grow. The spheres were then transferred to a 24-well plate pre\ufb01lled\nwith 300 \u00b5L medium and respective treatments with compounds ranging from 0.1 mg\/mL\nto 0.5 mg\/mL. In some experiments, the HCT116 culture (at a density of 10,000 cells\/10 \u00b5L)\nwas pretreated with 0.5 mg\/mL and 0.1 mg\/mL of the compounds during sphere formation.\nUntreated or pretreated spheres transferred to the adherent plate were allowed to adhere by\nincubation at 37\u25e6C for 4 h. Images were taken at 4 \u00d7magni\ufb01cation and this time was taken\nas t = 0 (4 h post-seeding of spheres into adherent plates). The spheroids were monitored\nover time for t = 24 h.

Wang et al. (2020) also reported vari -\nous cosmeceutical activities, including antioxidant, anti-\nmelanogenesis, and UV-protective activities, in vitro  and \nin vivo  (Wang et al. 2020). Enzyme-assisted hydrolysate \nfrom the stipe of E. maxima has antioxidant and anti-\ninflammatory potential (Lee et al. 2021) . In this study, \nwe purified fucoidan fractions from enzyme-assisted hy -\ndrolysate from E. maxima  stipe and assessed its inhibi -\ntory activity on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) \nand cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression using western \nblotting. We hypothesized that fucoidan from E. maxima \npossesses anti-inflammatory properties. The results of \nthis study may contribute to the utilization of E. maxima \nin the functional food industry.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials\nLipopolysaccharide and standard fucoidan were pur -\nchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dul -\nbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine \nserum (FBS), penicillin\/streptomycin (P\/S), and trypsin-\nEDTA solution were purchased from Welgene (Daegu, \nKorea). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleu -\nkin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and pros -\ntaglandin E2 (PGE2) were analyzed using a commercial \ncolorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit \nfrom R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Food-grade \nViscozyme obtained from Novozyme (Copenhagen, Den -\nmark). \nSample preparation and fucoidan purification \nvia ion-exchange chromatography\nE. maxima  stipe was kindly provided by the Univer -\nsity of Cape Town, South Africa, and hydrolyzed using \nViscozyme, as described by Lee et al. (2021). Briefly, 10 \ng of homogenized E. maxima  stipe suspended in 1 L of \ndistilled water and hydrolyzed with Viscozyme. After 24 \nh, the mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0 C, 12,000 rpm) and fil -\ntered. The filtrate was combined with double the volume \nof 95% EtOH and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. Twenty-four \nhours later, the precipitate was collected by centrifuga -\ntion. The collected precipitate dried and homogenized \nusing a grinder. The collected precipitate was named as \ncrude polysaccharide. Then, the crude polysaccharide veloped in Korea (Carrano et al. 2020, Ko et al. 2020).\nSeaweed is a promising source of secondary metabo -\nlites and it has several advantages, such as high availabil -\nity and low processing costs for industrial purposes com -\npared with the land plant. Recently, brown algae have \nreceived great attention because of their bioactive com -\npounds, especially the polysaccharide fucoidan, which \ncontains an abundance of sulfate groups that exhibit \nvarious biological activities. Sulfated polysaccharides are \nmajor components of brown seaweed and exhibit various \nbioactivities, including anti-coagulant, antioxidant, anti-\ninflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-viral, and \nhepatoprotective activities (Sanjeewa et al. 2018).\nThe functional food industry has become the most \nprofi table  and rapidly growing industry worldwide be -\ncause of the increased concern for human health owing \nto coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to \nstatistical reports, the global functional food market has \nbeen steadily growing, with the highest market share re -\ncorded in the United States (34.1 %), China (15.1 %), and \nthe European Union (12.3 %); the revenue of functional \nfood products in the United States was 48,892 million \nUSD in 2019 (KHSA 2021). Functional food products \nagainst immune and underlying diseases, including obe -\nsity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, have gained in -\ncreased popularity in modern society. An early publica -\ntion on food science and COVID-19 reported that specific \ndietary components and food supplements are important \nfor the prevention of COVID-19 (Lange 2021).

Although MSCs have\nthe potential for tissue regeneration, their therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy is restricted by the uremic toxin, p-cresol,\nin chronic kidney disease (CKD). To address this issue, we investigated the effect of fucoidan, a marine\nsulfated polysaccharide, on cellular senescence in MSCs. After p-cresol exposure, MSC senescence was\ninduced, as indicated by an increase in cell size and a decrease in proliferation capacity. Treatment of\nsenescent MSCs with fucoidan signi\ufb01cantly reversed this cellular senescence via regulation of SMP30\nand p21, and increased proliferation through the regulation of cell cycle-associated proteins (CDK2,\nCDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E). These effects were dependent on FAK-Akt-TWIST signal transduction.\nIn particular, fucoidan promoted the expression of cellular prion protein (PrPC), which resulted in the\nmaintenance of cell expansion capacity in p-cresol-induced senescent MSCs. This protective effect of\nfucoidan on senescence-mediated inhibition of proliferation was dependent on the TWIST-PrPCaxis.\nIn summary, this study shows that fucoidan protects against p-cresol-induced cellular senescence in\nMSCs through activation of the FAK-Akt-TWIST pathway and suggests that fucoidan could be used\nin conjunction with functional MSC-based therapies in the treatment of CKD.\nKeywords: cellular senescence; chronic kidney disease; fucoidan; mesenchymal stem cells; p-cresol\n1. Introduction\nMSCs are a major source for stem cell-based regenerative medicine because of their self-renewing\nand multipotent capacity [ 1]. They can be isolated from several tissues such as adipose tissue,\nbone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical blood [ 2]. Transplanted MSCs have shown\nremarkable therapeutic efficacy in preclinical disease models in terms of their expansion and\ndifferentiation potential, secretion of cytokines and growth factors, and immunomodulatory effects [ 3].\nHowever, the beneficial effects of MSCs in damaged tissues are restricted by pathophysiological\nconditions such as oxidative stress, limited nutrients, and ischemia, which result in death of the\ntransplanted cells. Therefore, it is important to develop novel strategies to protect MSCs under\npathophysiological conditions.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem due to a signi\ufb01cant increase\nin hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and aging [ 4]. Kidney dysfunction leads to the excretion\nof toxic metabolites, commonly referred to as uremic toxins. These toxic products accumulate in\nthe blood and have biochemical toxic effects in various tissues, which leads to complications such\nMar.

The levels of cell cycle-associated proteins, CDK2,\nCDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E were also reduced. After p-cresol exposure, treatment with fucoidan\nprotected MSCs against cellular senescence by regulating senescence- and proliferation-associated\nproteins. These findings indicate that fucoidan protects against p-cresol-induced cellular senescence\nthrough the regulation of senescence- and cell cycle-associated proteins.\nAkt signaling is a well-known regulator of cell survival and proliferation [ 22]. Fucoidan is\nreported to have a high af\ufb01nity for \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin [ 23], and our previous studies revealed that\nfucoidan activates FAK-Akt signaling in the enhancement of endothelial colony-forming cells and\nMSCs [ 11,12]. In addition, we found that Akt phosphorylation protects against cellular senescence\nthrough the downregulation of p21 and upregulation of SMP30 expression [ 11]. Moreover, fucoidan\nwas shown to improve MSC proliferation and survival by protecting against oxidative stress via the\nAkt-MnSOD axis [ 12]. To further elucidate the exact mechanism of action of fucoidan, downstream of\nthe FAK-Akt signal pathway, we focused on the role of TWIST signaling in recovering p-cresol-induced\nMSC senescence. Our results revealed that TWIST is downstream of the fucoidan-stimulated\nFAK-Akt signal pathway, and that fucoidan recovers the p-cresol-induced senescence of MSCs\nthrough FAK-Akt-TWIST-dependent signal transduction. TWIST is known to play a role in\nskeletal and mesodermal tissue development [ 24], and in cancer cells, TWIST induces metastasis,\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition, suppression of apoptosis, and generation of drug resistance [ 25].\nRecent studies have shown that TWIST has important stem\/progenitor cell properties [ 14,26], and\noverexpression enhances the maintenance and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells [ 26]. Senescent\nendothelial progenitor cells, because of replicative cultivation, can be recovered by activation of the\nhypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha-dependent TWIST pathway [ 14]. Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that\nfucoidan protects MSCs against p-cresol-induced cellular senescence through the FAK-Akt-TWIST axis.\nUnder pathophysiological conditions, the ef\ufb01cacy of MSC transplantation for regeneration is\nreduced owing to several risk factors such as oxidative stress, low nutrient levels, toxic metabolites,\nand in\ufb02ammation. MSCs isolated from CKD mice showed reduced functionality, including a decrease\nin proliferation, secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines, and neovascular formation [ 27]. In a murine\nhind-limb ischemia model associated with CKD, MSC transplantation did not signi\ufb01cantly enhance\nfunctional recovery or neovessel formation [ 13]. PrPC, a highly conserved and ubiquitous glycoprotein,\nis an important molecule with roles in stem cell expansion and self-renewal [ 15,28]. PrPCimproves\nMSC ex vivo expansion and engraftment to bone marrow [ 29]. Furthermore, PrPCexpression facilitates\nthe ef\ufb01cacy of MSC transplantation and neovascularization in a murine hind-limb ischemia model by\nenhancing their antioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory effects [ 16]. To understand the relationship between\nfucoidan and PrPCin MSC proliferation after p-cresol exposure, we assessed PrPCexpression and MSC\nexpansion capacity after p-cresol exposure and fucoidan treatment. Our data showed that fucoidan\nincreased the expression of PrPCand that its expression is dependent on the FAK-Akt-TWIST axis,\nresulting in augmentation of MSC expansion after p-cresol exposure. In addition, Fucoidan-pretreated\nMSCs increased growth factor secretion and cell survival rates after transplantation to ischemic site via\nthe increased expression of PrPC. These \ufb01ndings suggest that fucoidan protects against the inhibition\nofp-cresol-induced self-renewal in MSCs via TWIST-dependent upregulation of PrPCexpression.\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1.

We demonstrated that LMWF and HSFUCO could improve cardiac function\nin aging mice. Aging mice were treated with LMWF and HSFUCO, either on their own or\nin combination, on 28 consecutive days. Electrocardiography and whole-cell patch-clamp were\nused to measure QT interval and action potential duration (APD) of the subjects. Cardiac tissue\nmorphology, reactive oxygen species, and Western blot were also applied. Ultra-high-performance\nliquid chromatography\u2013quadrupole time-of-\ufb02ight (UPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometry was used for\ninvestigating metabolic alterations. The use of LMWF and HSFUCO resulted in improvements in\nboth ventricular rhythms (QT and APD). Treatment with fucoidan and fucoxanthin reduced the\nexpression levels of SOS1 and GRB2 while increasing GSK3 \u03b2, CREB and IRS1 proteins expression in\nthe aging process. Three main metabolic pathways, namely the TCA cycle, glycolysis, and steroid\nhormone biosynthesis, were highly enriched in the pathway enrichment analysis. When taken\ntogether, the LMWF and HSFUCO treatment improved both the ventricular rhythm and the muscular\nfunction of aging subjects by interfering with the metabolism and gene function.\nKeywords: fucoidan; fucoxanthin; aging mice; metabolomics; long QT\n1. Introduction\nAging is a process accompanied by many associated degenerative diseases, such as cancer,\ncardiovascular disease, and dementia [ 1]. Cardiac structural remodeling and muscular atrophy are the\nmost severe forms of cardiac disease [ 2\u20134]. There are many approaches to curing cardiovascular disease\nand, recently, natural products derived from herbs have been extensively studied for their ability to\nimprove cardiovascular function [ 5\u20137]. Numerous brown seaweeds contain this sulfated, fucosylated\npolysaccharide phytochemical compound. The biological and chemical properties of fucoidan\nvary according to the particular type of brown seaweed and the extraction method employed [ 8].\nAntitumor [ 9], antiviral [ 10], anti-in\ufb02ammatory [ 11], and anticoagulant [ 12] activities are the main\nproperties of this compound, which are strongly associated with its molecular weight [ 13] and\nsulfate content [ 14]. Fucoidan has long been known as a good antioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory\ncompound [ 15\u201319]. Recently, several studies have focused on low molecular weight fucoidan due to its\nhigher level of biological activity [ 15,20\u201323]. Fucoidan has also been used with myocardial infarction\nin a rat model, and here it showed a cardioprotective effect by reversing the damage to the region\ninduced by isoproterenol [ 24]. Fucoidan can protect against the damage caused by myocardial\nMar.

Could you help me understand what the purpose of Hydrothermal gasification is?","reference_answer":"Hydrothermal gasification is a thermochemical conversion of biomass to biofuels under hot compressed water. This process is most commonly used for the production of H2 and CH4 rich syngas.","reference_context":"Document 2834: phenolic compounds can be controlled according to the temperature pressure and\nheating rate of the hydrothermal treatment [ 12,74]. Fast heating hydrothermal\nreaction of lignin conducted at sub and supercritical water conditions using a\ncontinuous \ufb02ow reactor by Abad-Fernandez et al. [ 12], who reported that higher\noil yields were obtained at high temperatures and short reaction times (seconds)compared with low temperature and long reaction time conditions. Those authorsspeculated that enhancement of oil at high temperatures and short reaction times wasdue to enhanced fragmentation of the lignin and the reduction of secondary reactionsto form char [ 12]. Further details on lignin conversion can be found in reviews\n[64,66,75].\nLipids are biomolecules found in biomass. The lipid content can reach up to\n20\u201330% for microalgae [ 76]. Lipids consist of one tryglyceride and three fatty acid\nlinked by a ester bonds. Lipids can be converted into biodiesel, fatty acid methylesters (FAME), by transester \ufb01cation using a catalyst. Biodiesel can be used as fuel\nfor diesel engines directly or after simple modi \ufb01cation. Details of these processes can\nbe found in the literature [ 76\u201379]. Lipids can also be converted into liquid fuel via\nproduction of biocrude and hydrogenation using catalysts [ 80]. Biocrude is a\nsubstance obtained by often the hydrothermal liquefaction process (HTL) ofmicroalgae and various organic solids. Hydrothermal liquefaction has an advantage\nfor processing organic solids with high water content as no drying is required. The\nreaction mechanism of biocrude under hydrothermal conditions is considered to startwith the fragmentation of the individual biopolymers often through the hydrolysiscontinued with secondary condensation reactions between the fragmentated com-pounds to form biocrude compounds as shown in Fig. 11.10 [81,82]. Fast heating\nhydrothermal liquefaction of organic solids to obtain biocrude from feedstocks suchas bacteria and yeast monocultures [ 83], green marine alga [ 84], chitin [ 85],\nmicroalgae [ 86], polysaccharides [ 87], sewage sludge [ 88], and model food wastes\n[13] have been reported by the group of Savage [ 13,83\u201388], indicating that fast\nheating rates increase the biocrude yields compared to slow hydrothermal heatingconditions often discussed by the suppression of condensation reactions to result inthe formation of char. The interested reader is referred to reviews in the literature formore detailed studies on hydrothermal liquefaction processes [ 80,81,89].11 Fundamentals of Hydrothermal Processing of Biomass-Related Molecules for ... 357\n\nDocument 766: 106 R. Divyabharathi and P . Subramanian\nremaining aqueous phase may have lignin dissolved which may break down to form\nphenolic compounds. Phenols on polymerization in hydrothermal media produces\nformaldehyde which in turn results in cross-linking to form hydro-char compounds(Y oshida and Matsumura 2001 ). Thus, cellulose and lignin-based biomass should be\nused with heterogeneous catalysts like Ru in supercritical gasi\ufb01cation to completely\ngasify and form CH\n4and CO 2(Osada et al. 2004 ). HTG is therefore advantageous in\nprocessing wet biomass to produce H 2and CH 4rich gases which can be potentially\nused in power generation, chemical synthesis and for fuel cell applications.\n4.6 Extraction and Analysis of Hydrothermal Products\nThere are various procedures for extraction of each type of hydrothermal products.\nIn general, after hydrothermal processing, the condensable vapors are collected asliquid products, non-condensable gaseous product is vented or sometimes collected in\ntedlar bags and the remaining solid product from reactor is \ufb01ltered. The condensable\nliquid product has biocrude mixed with water which can be separated by solvent\nextraction techniques and the solvent can be removed by vacuum \ufb01ltration (Alba\net al. 2012 ). In cases where homogeneous alkaline catalysts are used, the quality of\nbiocrude extraction can be enhanced by dual solvent extraction process using two\ntypical polar and non-polar solvents (Karagoz et al. 2005 ). The reaction mixture\ncontaining solid product dissolved in water is \ufb01ltered to get aqueous phase whichmay contain water soluble organics and the \ufb01ltrate is obtained as solid hydro-char\nby drying in hot air oven at 103 \u00b12\u00b0 C .\nThe biocrude obtained after solvent extraction is a viscous organic liquid that has\nhigh C\/H ratio comparable to conventional crude. This can be veri\ufb01ed by GC-MS\nand FT-IR analyses by detecting the functional groups present in the product. The\naqueous phase is centrifuged and can be analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) andfor chemical composition by GC-MS. The solid hydro-char can be analyzed by FT-IR\nand SEM to identify the functional compounds and the formation of pore structures\nrespectively. After the detection of chemical compounds in hydrothermal products bythese analyses, the selective extraction of those chemicals is found to be challenging.\nThis is due to the complexity of organics present in the products. However, certain\nliquid-liquid extraction techniques may selectively recover phenols and certain acids,which may be used for chemical substitution or for industrial applications (Hu et al.\n2012 ). In case of alkaline catalyst usage in hydrothermal processing, it is dif\ufb01cult to\nseparate liquids and solids. This is because catalysts retain in solid product which\nmay in turn retain solids in liquid fraction. This can be recti\ufb01ed by the addition of\nacids like HCl during extraction (Miller et al. 1999 ). The separation and extraction\nof products post hydrothermal processing is shown in Fig. 4.6.\n\nDocument 5820: Vardon DR, Sharma BK, Blazina GV et al (2012) Thermochemical conversion of raw and defatted\nalgal biomass via hydrothermal liquefaction and slow pyrolysis.

Biomass molecules which areinsoluble in water at normal conditions undergo rapid hydrolysis under supercritical\nconditions, making the fragments of biomass to dissolve, which in turn prevents the\nformation of hydro-char (Kruse 2009 ) and paves way for higher gas production. HTG\nis most commonly used for the production of H\n2and CH 4rich syngas and it depends\non the temperature and catalyst used. The process may produce hydrogen rich gas\nat temperatures >500 \u00b0C under non-catalytic or non-metallic catalytic conditions,\nor it may produce methane rich gas at temperatures between 374 and 500 \u00b0C under\nmetallic catalytic condition or it may produce a combined syngas product usingheterogeneous catalysts at near critical condition (Kruse 2008 ). The chemistry of\nsupercritical biomass degradation is complex such that there will be an occurrence\nof hydrolysis, fragmentation, methanation, water-gas and water gas shift reactionssimultaneously. High temperatures and pressures fragment the bonds of complex\nbiopolymers to produce syngas compounds of H\n2,C H 4,C O 2and CO. To further\nspecialize the process and to enable a sole-rich gas, a catalyst addition is needed.Heterogeneous catalysts such as Ni, Pt, Rh and Rb or homogeneous alkaline catalysts\nsuch as Na\n2CO 3,K 2CO 3, NaCl and KCl may be used at temperatures between 500\nand 800 \u00b0C to promote water-gas-shift reactions and other free radical reactions,generating hydrogen and methane rich gas products (Lee et al. 2002 ). This is also\ndependable on the biomass composition like carbon and hydrogen content and also\non the reaction time of HTG. The Eqs. ( 4.7)t o( 4.10 ) shows the reaction network of\nhydrothermal gasi\ufb01cation of glucose.\nC\n6H12O6+6H 2O\u21926C O 2+12 H 2(hydrolysis reaction ) (4.7)\nCH xOy+(1\u2212y)H2O\u2192CO+(x\/2+1\u2212y)H2(water gas reaction ) (4.8)\nCO+3H 2\u2192CH 4+H2O(methanation reaction ) (4.9)\nCO+H2O\u2192CO 2+H2(water gas shift reaction ) (4.10)\nIn the HTG study on glucose, the gasi\ufb01cation reactions were favorable to H 2\nformation and CO formation decreased at increased temperatures >600 \u00b0C under\nnon-catalytic conditions, which was due to the rapid rate and dominance of water-\ngas-shift reaction (Xu et al. 1996 ). This rate was found to decrease when the concen-\ntration of glucose was increased. Hence to alter this, non-metallic catalyst like acti-vated carbon can be added to completely convert glucose to hydrogen rich gas.

Other pertinent question concerns the intrinsic levels of net conversion of CO 2\nand steam with char; this question is one of the important ones that will be addressed\nhere. Results from our recent lab studies (described herein) provide answers for\nall of the above questions. Before discussing the results from these studies, a briefdiscussion of relevant literature is presented.\n6.1.4 Earlier Studies on Oxy-Fuel Biomass Systems\nIt is pertinent to point out that the questions posed above cannot be answered usinganalytical methods like TGA, DTA etc. In fact, we can go one step further and statethat these important questions itself could be posed only because of the canonical\nplatform provided by counter-current packed bed con\ufb01guration. The reasons for this\nis explained in some detail in the following paragraphs.\nA number of studies have been carried out to explore the role of O\n2\u2013CO 2\u2013steam\u2013\nN2(in varying proportions) in biomass\/coal gasi\ufb01cation\/combustion reactors. Lab\nscale TGA\/DTA (Dai et al. 2017 ; Huo et al. 2014 ; Sircar et al. 2014 ; Butterman and\nCastaldi 2009 ; Lin and Strand 2013 ; Bouraoui et al. 2015 ) and Drop Tube Reactor\n(DTR) studies (Kyotani et al. 1993 ); Riaza et al. 2014 ; Billaud et al. 2016 ; Ranzi\net al. 2013 ) are the predominant ones among these. While TGA\/DTA studies are\nconducted in the 1\u2013100 K\/min heating rate range and 700\u20131400\u25e6C peak temperature\nrange, DTR studies use ultra high heating rates of O(104)K\/s. On the other hand,\nheating rates expereinced by particled in practical con\ufb01gurations are in the range of afew 1000 K\/min. This makes results of the TGA\/DTA and DTR studies less relevant\nin actual applications.\nStudies with practical con\ufb01gurations like \ufb01xed bed (updraft and downdraft con-\n\ufb01guration) and \ufb02uidized bed systems are also been reported in literature.

It is also important to note that in this zone, the peak bed temperatures are high\n(1500 \u2264Tpb\u22641800 K) which leads to melting of reactors and ash fusion problems.\nZone V represents the char oxidation zone ( \u03c6v<1).\nParticle size is another variable that brings in effects that need to be considered\nin addition to those discussed so far. The key result from Jaganathan et al. ( 2017 )\nis that, with air as oxidizer, the cut-off size for the condition tig>tvto be satis\ufb01ed\n(that is, for steady propagation) is 20 mm. Beyond this size, a mild case of \ufb02amejump is observed. Corresponding particle sizes for other oxidizer combinations can\nbe estimated using the procedure outlined in Jaganathan et al. ( 2017 ), Jaganathan\n(2019 ).\n6.6 Implications for Practical Gasi\ufb01cation Systems\nSome important implications of the results discussed so far for practical systems are\nlisted below.\n1. Normalization of fuel \ufb02ux variations from different O 2fractions is addressed\nthrough normalized fuel \ufb02ux ( NFF ), which shows the regimes of \u2018gasi\ufb01cation\u2019\nand \u2018char oxidation\u2019 as a function of \u03c6vand also shows applicability of \u2018universal\nbehavior\u2019 to all fuel\u2013oxidizer combinations. This is an important result to designand operate biomass packed bed systems. By \ufb01xing a \u03c6\nvvalue for operation,\n\nDocument 858: 160 V . M. Jaganathan and S. V arunkumar\n6.4 Mechanism of Gasi\ufb01cation to Char Oxidation Regime\nTransition in Packed Beds\nFollowing up on an earlier hypothesis that the gasi\ufb01cation to char oxidation transition\ncould be linked to the transition of envelope \ufb02ame to wake \ufb02ame for particles in a\npacked bed and that this transition is driven by extinction of the volatiles \ufb02ame in the\nforward stagnation point , Mani Kalyani et al. 2021 ) have reported estimates for strain\nrate experienced by particles in packed beds and the behavior of single particles in\ncorresponding conditions. But in addition to the two states, that is envelope and wake\n\ufb02ame, a third \ufb02ame-state, simultaneous volatiles-char oxidation state , was identi\ufb01ed\nin the experiments of Mani Kalyani et al. ( 2021 ). Figure 6.7, shows all the three\npossible states of the \ufb02ame around a particle in a stream of oxidizer.\nIt is shown in Mani Kalyani et al. ( 2021 ) that the bed operates in gasi\ufb01cation\nregime if the particle \ufb02ame state is envelope \ufb02ame ; this is consistent with the fact\nthat only in the existence of an envelope \ufb02ame, the char will be shielded from oxygen\nand hence will be available for reduction reactions (which is essential for gasi\ufb01ca-\ntion). The operating regime transitions from gasi\ufb01cation to char oxidation when theenvelope \ufb02ame transitions to either the wake \ufb02ame (Fig. 6.7b) or the simultaneous\nvolatiles-char oxidation \ufb02ame state (Fig. 6.7c). Results reported in Mani Kalyani\net al. ( 2021 ) show that for oxidizers with O\n2fraction (v\/v) up to about 25%, the wake\n\ufb02ame transition is observed; for O 2fraction >30%, the simultaneous volatiles-char\noxidation \ufb02ame state transition is observed. The implications of these insights are\nas follows\u2014if one wishes to know apriori the oxidizer mass \ufb02ux at which a packedbed will transition from gasi\ufb01cation to char oxidation, all that one needs to do is to\ndetermine the \ufb02ame transition velocities for single particles.\nWith this the discussion of insights from experiments and analysis is complete.\nWhat follows is a review of the advances in the theoretical aspects of \ufb02ame propa-\ngation in packed beds.\n6.5 A Theoretical Framework for the Phenomenon\nof Flame Jump\nThe recognition of the universal \ufb02ame propagation behavior, by V arunkumar et al.\n(2013 ), in packed beds of biomass with air as oxidizer and the corresponding trans-\nport controlled model has remained the principal theoretical result for over a decade\non this topic. Therefore any attempts at extending the theoretical framework for this\nproblem should start by identifying the shortcomings of the universal \ufb02ame propa-\ngation model . One obvious shortcoming is the use of data with only air as oxidizer;\nthis was because of the lack of systematic data with other oxidizers. Now that data\nfor other oxidizers have become available, the \ufb01rst task would be to determine if\nthe \u2018 universality \u2019 could be extended to the entire data set. The answer is yes and the\napproach used to establish this fact is described below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":4668,"situational_context":"A laboratory researcher has been studying the effect of various oxidizers on algae and is seeking insights from an AI to understand the flame-state behavior in the context of gasification and combustion reactions.","topic":"Combustion and Gasification Processes"}}

J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 9272 10 of 19\n2.2.3. E \ufb00ects on RPE Survival and Function\nFucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus purchased by Sigma Aldrich at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g\/mL\ndid not exert any toxicity on the ARPE-19 cell line or primary RPE cells tested for up to one\nweek. Similarly, proliferation was not altered by this fucoidan [ 85]. In another study, the e \ufb00ects of\ncharacterized fucoidans from six di \ufb00erent algae ( Saccharina latissima ,Laminaria digitata ,Fucus serratus ,\nFucus vesiculosus ,Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus , and Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens (all from the Baltic\nSea except for Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata (North Atlantic)) and extracted by hot water\nextraction) [ 86] on the survival of RPE cell line ARPE-19 and uveal melanoma cell line OMM-1after\n24 h of stimulation were tested [ 95]. The fucoidan from Fucus serratus decreased cell viability in a\nconcentration-dependent manner, while the fucoidan from Laminaria digitata induced an increase in the\nviability signal [ 95]. In OMM-1 cells, viability was also reduced by Fucus serratus , and additionally by\nthe fucoidans from Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus and Fucus evanescens. The fucoidans from Fucus vesiculosus\nand Laminaria digitata increased cell viability, and the fucoidan from Saccharina latissima produced\nmixed results [ 95]. No correlation with any chemical characteristics could be shown, but an e \ufb00ect\nof purity on cell survival (with less toxicity correlated with better purity) has been discussed by the\nauthors [ 95]. However, in a study investigating a crude fucoidan extract of Fucus distichus subsp.\nevanescens , no toxicity was found for ARPE-19 or primary RPE cells in concentrations up to 250 \u00b5g\/mL\nand for up to 7 d of stimulation [87].\nIn another study, the e \ufb00ects on viability of three di \ufb00erent fucoidans from Laminaria hyperborea\nwere tested. These fucoidans were highly pure with 97.0% fucose and a degree of sulfation of 1.7.\nThe main di \ufb00erence among these fucoidans was the molecular weight, with a high-molecular weight\nfucoidan (1548 kDa), a medium-molecular weight fucoidan (499 kDa), and a low-molecular weight\nfucoidan (26.9 kDa) [ 90]. When applied to the uveal melanoma cell line OMM-1, fucoidans of medium\nand high-molecular weight reduced the cell viability of these cells (50 and 100 \u00b5g\/mL), while no\ne\ufb00ect was seen regarding the viability of ARPE-19 or primary human RPE cells after 24 h. In the\nstudy with fucoidans obtained by enzyme assisted extraction ( Saccharina latissima (North Atlantic),\nLaminaria digitata (Baltic Sea), and Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens (Baltic Sea)), none of the tested\nfucoidans exerted any toxicity on OMM-1 cells or ARPE-19 cells after 24 h [91].\nOverall, fucoidans exert few e \ufb00ects on the viability of ocular cells. However, purity might be of\nsome importance. An overview of the fucoidans tested for their e \ufb00ects on the viability in ocular cells is\ngiven in Table 3.\nAn important task of RPE cells is the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments in order\nto recycle used visual pigment and support regeneration of the photoreceptors [ 66]. A fucoidan from\nFucus vesiculosus (from Sigma Aldrich, at 100 \u00b5g\/mL) did not in\ufb02uence the phagocytic ability of primary\nRPE cells in short term stimulation. However, this fucoidan did reduce the wound-healing abilities of\nARPE-19 and primary RPE cells [ 85]. Crude fucoidan from Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens , however,\ndisplayed a profound impact on phagocytosis of primary RPE, reducing it after 24 h (100 and 250 \u00b5g\/mL),\n3 d (1\u2013250 \u00b5g\/mL), and 7 d (100 and 250 \u00b5g\/mL). This fucoidan also delayed the wound-healing of\nprimary RPE cells [ 87]. These \ufb01nding show the importance of testing the speci\ufb01c fucoidan to be used\non the function of RPE cells.

Compared to our results,\nCREB protein expression level decreased in the aging group. The lower down expression level\n\nDocument 974: Mar. Drugs 2019 ,17, 69 14 of 18\nmay be caused by CREB phosphorylation. Another research focusing on advanced glycation product\nreceptors (AGERs) relating to diabetes and aging mentioned that tyrosine phosphorylation has been\nshown to cause MAPK activation through Grb2 and Sos. In addition, Sos protein is one guanine\nnucleotide-exchange factor, resulting in Shc\/Grb2 complex formation [ 60]. Based on this research\nresult, we can con\ufb01rm that this, consistent with our results, may explain why Grb2 and Sos protein\nlevel expressions change drastically with age. IRS-1 is known for its role in the regulation of cell and\nbody size, and it is one of membranous or cytoplasmic proteins [ 35]. In addition, one former study\nrelated to lifespan and aging indicated Irs1\u2212\/\u2212mice are long-living [36].\nShe-GRB2-SOS is also known to be an important pathway in the cardiac myocytes [ 34].\nIn our study, the levels of these proteins were changed through supplementing with fucoidan and\nfucoxanthin. After the treatment, the expression of these proteins in the aging mice came close to\nthose of the young mice subjects.\nThe citric acid (TCA) cycle plays an important role in various related metabolic pathways.\nTCA also plays a role in gluconeogenesis, transamination, deamination, and lipogenesis [ 61].\nThe precursor of all steroid hormones is cholesterol, mostly provided by plasma lipoproteins circulating\nas low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Cholesterol participates in corticosteroid biosynthesis [ 62].\nThe synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones is closely associated with the progression of aging [ 63].\nA relative increase in intracellular metabolites is evident in senescent cells, including glycolysis,\ngluconeogenesis, and the pentose\u2013phosphate pathway [64].\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, the protein expression levels of SOS1, GSK3 \u03b2, GRB2, CREB and IRS1 in aging\nmice were ameliorated with fucoidan and fucoxanthin. There were also signi\ufb01cant improvements\nin cardiac morphology and muscular function after the aging mice were fed with fucoidan alone or\nfucoidan supplemented with fucoxanthin. Altogether, these \ufb01ndings indicate the potential for the\namelioration of aging through enhancement of the metabolism and gene function of aging subjects\nusing marine products such as fucoidan and fucoxanthin.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/17\/1\/69\/s1,\nFigure S1: ADP90 trace data; ( a) YC, ( b) SC, ( c) FD, ( d) FX, ( e) FD + FX.
