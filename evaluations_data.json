The system also utilizes the cold\\nheat of reaction heat during the hydrogen desorption process for air conditioning.\\nThe basic operation of THEUS is as follows. At night, hydrogen is produced by\\nwater electrolysis using low-cost nighttime electric power with low CO 2emission\\nand stores the hydrogen in metal hydride tanks. During the day, electric power isgenerated by the fuel cell using the stored hydrogen to meet the electric powerdemand of the building. The chilled water and hot water generated in theseprocesses are also utilized. Electric power from renewable energy, such as photo-voltaic and wind power, can also be used for hydrogen production. In the future,THEUS can supply energy to fuel cell vehicles (FCV).\\nTHEUS optimizes the integration of energy storage and polygeneration of\\nelectric power, cold source, heat source, and hydrogen to meet energy demand,\\nbalances load leveling, and stores renewable energy such as solar energy and windenergy. THEUS can bridge the gap between renewable energy and energy demand.Use of renewable energy sources becomes easier when THEUS is installed becauseﬂuctuations in electrical power loads can be managed.\\nHydrogen storage tanks with metal hydrides are one of the important elements of\\nTHEUS (Fig. 40.4). The goal of this tank is to recover the cold heat of the\\nendothermic process for air conditioning and thus improve the efﬁciency of\\nTHEUS. The storage tank contains 50 kg of metal hydride. Absorption and desorp-\\ntion of 5,400 NL of hydrogen was successfully attained when the absorption ratewas 10 NL/min and the desorption rate was 6.9 NL/min. A 24-h cycle experimentemulating hydrogen generation at night and power generation during the dayrevealed that the system achieved a ratio of recovered thermal energy to the entirereaction heat of the hydrogen storage system of 43.2 % without heat loss [ 12,13].\\nFig. 40.4 Cooling power as function of ﬂuid mass ﬂow rate for different magnetic materials558 F.

Ermine had been used in Brittany long before, and there is no clue to its origin. It was probably chosen by the dukes because of its similarity with the French fleur-de-lis. The ermine, or stoat, as an animal became the badge of John IV at the end of the 14th century. It appeared later on numerous locations, including churches and castles. According to popular traditions, Anne of Brittany was hunting with her court when she saw a white ermine who preferred to die than to cross a dirty marsh. This episode would have inspired the duchess\\' motto : \"Potius mori quam foedari\" (\"rather death than dishonour\"). The motto has later been reused by Breton regiments, local World War II Resistants and cultural movements.\\nThe Breton anthem, although not official, is Bro Gozh ma Zadoù – (\"Old Land of My Fathers\").

        "user_question_enriched": "Not enriched",
        "LLM_answer": "During the blanching of Saccharina latissima, which is a type of brown algae commonly known as sugar kelp, the pigments present in the algae may undergo changes. Blanching typically involves quickly immersing the algae in boiling water or steam for a short period of time.\n\nThe main pigments found in brown algae like Saccharina latissima are chlorophylls, carotenoids, and fucoxanthin. Blanching can affect these pigments in the following ways:\n\n1. Chlorophylls: Chlorophylls are the green pigments responsible for photosynthesis in algae. They are sensitive to heat and light, and blanching can cause some degradation of chlorophyll molecules, leading to a loss of green color in the algae.\n\n2. Carotenoids: Carotenoids are another group of pigments found in algae that are responsible for orange, red, and yellow colors. These pigments are more stable to heat compared to chlorophylls, but prolonged blanching at high temperatures can still lead to a reduction in carotenoid content.\n\n3. Fucoxanthin: Fucoxanthin is a brown pigment unique to brown algae and is responsible for their characteristic brown color. While fucoxanthin is relatively stable to heat, prolonged blanching or exposure to high temperatures can cause some degradation, potentially leading to a loss of the brown color in the algae.\n\nIn general, blanching of Saccharina latissima can lead to changes in the pigments present in the algae, resulting in alterations in color and potentially some loss of pigment content. It is important to carefully control the blanching process to minimize negative effects on the pigments while achieving the desired texture and flavor of the algae.",

Factors such as water temperature, nutrient availability, and light intensity can influence the composition of this algae. \n\nGenerally, Saccharina latissima is known to have a high content of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. However, the specific levels of these compounds can differ based on environmental conditions. For example, kelp grown in colder waters may have a higher content of certain carbohydrates to help it survive in colder temperatures, while kelp grown in nutrient-rich waters may have higher levels of certain minerals.\n\nStudies have shown that environmental factors play a significant role in shaping the nutritional and chemical composition of algae. Therefore, researchers often analyze the chemical profile of Saccharina latissima from different regions to understand how these variations may impact its potential applications in various industries, such as food, feed, and biofuel production.",

Antioxidant Activities of SC1, SC2, and SC3\\nThe antioxidant activities of SC1–SC3 were examined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)\\nand 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) methods. DPPH\\nis known to be a stable free radical and is widely used to evaluate the antioxidant activity in a relatively\\nshort time compared to other methods [ 31]. Figure 4A shows the DPPH radical scavenging properties\\nof SC1, SC2, SC3, and vitamin C (as a reference). It can be seen that SC1–SC3 displayed DPPH\\nradical scavenging activity in a dose-dependent pattern. ABTS•+is a long-lived cation free radical,\\nwhich is decolorized during the reaction with hydrogen-donating antioxidant [ 35]. The ABTS•+\\nscavenging properties of SC1, SC2, SC3, and 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid\\n(Trolox) (as a reference) are presented in Figure 4B. All samples (SC1–SC3) showed ABTS•+scavenging\\nactivity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, previous investigations have demonstrated that\\noxidative stress-induced cell damage was implicated both in the physiological process of aging and in\\nneurodegenerative diseases [ 3,4]. Thus, the antioxidant activities of SC1–SC3 warrant further study to\\nfully elucidate their neuroprotective functions.', metadata={'authors': 'Wen-Ning Yang, Po-Wei Chen, Chun-Yung Huang  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC5484133.pdf', 'page': 6.0, 'publication_date': '2017', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC5484133.pdf', 'title': 'Compositional Characteristics and In Vitro Evaluations of Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Properties of Crude Extracts of Fucoidan Prepared from Compressional Puffing-Pretreated Sargassum crassifolium  '}), Document(page_content='Int.

This distribution of S. sculpera  was consid -\\nered to be because it has a higher affinity for low light in -\\ntensity environments, and that the plant may be subject \\nto photoinhibition at higher light intensities (Sato et al. \\n2020). In this study, S. sculpera  showed the fastest growth \\nat 5 m depth, where the light intensity was higher than \\nat greater depths. This suggests that photoinhibition did \\nnot occur under the higher light intensity. It seems more \\nlikely that S. sculpera  occurs mainly in deeper waters not \\nbecause it is adapted to low light intensities, but because \\nthe vertical distribution is limited at shallow depths by \\nhigh water temperatures in summer. \\nThe vertical distribution of water temperature in tem -\\nperate zones such as Korea is known to have seasonal \\nvariation (Sumich and Morrissey 2004). At the cultivation \\narea used in this study, the water temperatures between 1  \\nand 25 m were relatively s table  from December to March \\n(winter season), while a thermocline was observed at \\nshallow depths (10 m) in June (early summer season) \\nand at deeper depths (25 m) in August ( Table  2). Jeong \\net al. (2013) reported that in the East Sea coast of Korea, \\nthe water temperature-depth profile is uniform in winter \\nas seasonal winds induce vertical mixing. In summer, a \\nthermocline starts to develop due to the warming of the \\nsea surface, which becomes strongest in August. In au -\\ntumn, the mixed layer becomes deeper due to cooling on \\nthe sea surface. These patterns align well with the vertical \\ndistribution pattern of the water temperature observed \\nin this study. \\nTani et al. (2015) reported that, for the S. sculpera  popu -\\nlation off the coast of Hakodate, Japan, the recruitment of \\nnew thalli occurs from January to June, when the average \\nmonthly water temperature ranges between 5 and 15 ℃. \\nKirihara et al.

Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell walls of brown algae, while alginate is a linear polysaccharide also abundant in brown algae. \n\nVarious extraction methods can be used to obtain both fucoidan and alginate simultaneously from brown algae. One common method is the sequential extraction approach, where the algae biomass is first treated with a solvent to extract fucoidan, followed by a subsequent extraction process to recover alginate. This approach ensures high yields of both compounds.\n\nAlternatively, some studies have reported simultaneous extraction of fucoidan and alginate using specific extraction techniques such as enzyme-assisted extraction or ultrasound-assisted extraction. These methods are efficient in extracting both compounds simultaneously, leading to higher yields.\n\nOverall, with the right extraction technique and method optimization, it is feasible to obtain high yields of fucoidan and alginate simultaneously from brown algae.",

For \\nthese samples, iodide was then determined indirectly by \\ntaking the difference between total iodine and free iodate \\nin samples as concentrations of non-oxidizable organ -\\noiodine species are expected to be very low. The spec -\\ntrophotometric method of Truesdale (1978) relies on the \\nreaction of iodate with excess iodide to form triiodide, \\nwhich absorbs at 350 nm. We modified this method to \\nmake it microscale by using 3 mL samples and measur -\\ning the OD at 350 nm on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\\nStatistical analysis\\nAll statistical analyses were done using Systat ver. 12 \\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or as implemented in \\nSigmaPlot 12.5 (Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA). Prior \\nto testing, all data were examined for normality by graph -\\nical interpretation of the residuals using probability plots, \\nand for equal variances using Bartlett’s test, which veri -\\nfied data were normally distributed and homoscedastic. \\nA one-way ANOVA was then used to evaluate differences \\nin iodide concentrations between the seawater collected \\nfrom within the kelp holdfasts, in the middle of the kelp \\nfronds, at the seawater surface, and in the water column \\nwithin the kelp clearing. Following this, Tukey’s honestly \\nsignificant difference post hoc  tests were used to assess \\ndifferences in iodide concentrations between pairs of \\nsampling locations.\\nRESUL TS\\nEnsenada cruise\\nWater samples collected both at the surface and at the \\nDCM showed that the average concentration of iodide at \\nboth depths was similar at 93 ± 20 nM. Overall, the distri -\\nbution of iodide was fairly uniform ( Fig. 2) but with two \\n“hot spots” (near stations 21, 22, 26, and 27), where the \\niodide concentration reached as high as 300 nM and to -\\ntal iodine of >650 nM. We initially considered these high \\nvalues to be the result of some factor in the water that in -\\nterfered with the CSSWV method used to measure iodide. \\nHowever, reanalysis of these water samples using two \\ntotally different analytical procedures (DPV and spec -\\ntrophotometry) continued to indicate highly elevated io -\\ndide and total iodine levels.

Thus, Effect of Ectocarpus siliculosus  on iodine specia -\\ntion\\nThe filamentous brown alga  Ectocarpus siliculosus  was \\ngrown at 20°C under a 12 h light / dark cycle. Scripps Pier \\nseawater was filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 μm Millipore \\nfilters, adjusted to pH 8.3, and autoclaved. Provasoli en -\\nrichment media (Starr and Zeikus 1993) was then added \\nto the seawater after it cooled. Cultures were grown in Er -\\nlenmeyer flasks with approximately 450 to 600 mL of me -\\ndia. An inoculum of 8-17 mg squeezed-weight biomass \\nper mL of media was used.

The lack of any corresponding increase in \\niodide when iodate was low suggested that iodate was ac -\\ntually being removed from the media rather than being \\nconverted to iodide.\\nIn situ water sampling in the kelp forest. All samples \\ncollected within centimetres of the kelp showed a reduc -\\ntion in total iodine levels. Indeed, iodide concentrations \\nvaried significantly among the seawater collected from \\nthe holdfasts, within the kelp fronds, in the mid-water, \\nand at the sea surface (ANOVA: F3,8 = 10.104, p = 0.004). \\nSpecially, iodide concentrations were significantly lower \\nin the holdfasts than in the clearings or at the surface \\n(Tukey’s: p = 0.024 and p = 0.006, respectively), and tended \\nto be lower, albeit not significantly, than in the fronds (p = \\n0.745). Likewise, iodide concentrations were significant -\\nly lower in the kelp fronds than at the surface (Tukey’s: \\n0.022) and were marginally lower in the kelp fronds than \\nin the clearings (p = 0.098). In contrast, iodide did not dif -\\nfer between the kelp clearings and at the sea surface (p = \\n0.728). Nevertheless, concentrations of iodide decreased \\nonly slightly and stayed within the range typically ob -\\nserved in coastal waters. Thus, the overall reduction in \\ntotal iodine appeared to be driven mostly by decreases \\nin iodate ( Fig. 6). It is important to note that the overall \\nreduction in iodate was not mirrored by a correspond -\\ning increase in iodide (which also declined) indicating \\nthat the loss of iodate was due to an actual loss from the \\nwater column and not due to a change in speciation via \\nreduction. The iodate loss was strongest for the samples \\ncollected within the haptera of the holdfast, where total \\niodine levels where iodate levels were only one-third of \\nthat observed in controls. \\nDISCUSSION\\nOverall, it appears that under “normal” circumstanc -\\nes the concentration of iodate in southern California \\n/ northern Baja coastal waters is between 250-400 nM, \\nwith iodide concentrations between 50-150 nM as deter -\\nmined both at Scripps Pier and the Baja cruise. These val -\\nues are entirely in accord with other reports (Chance et \\nal. 2014). By “normal” we refer to situations in which ei -\\nther biological activity (phytoplankton cell counts) were \\nlow (i.e., Scripps Pier during the 2014-2015 year, or the \\nBaja Cruise of 2017), or where phytoplankton cell counts iodate is taken up or is converted to iodide. We initially \\nsought to determine the time frame for any purported \\nuptake of iodate by Ectocarpus , which showed that at am -\\nbient iodate concentrations (200-400 nM) iodate uptake \\nwas unobservable over the 24 h time period commonly \\nused for iodide uptake experiments, consistent with oth -\\ner studies. However, extending the exposure time to io -\\ndate for this relatively slow-growing organism from hours \\nto days / weeks led to an apparent decrease in the iodate \\nconcentration in the media, as seen in Fig. 5.

Microalgae and cyanobacte -\\nria are responsible for half of the planet’s primary  productivity \\nand the generated new oxygen into the atmosphere (Shestakov \\n& Karbysheva, 2017 ).\\nThere are tens of thousands of species, which exhibit a \\nmultitude of shapes, sizes, and colors.\\nThey are the first step in the food chain in the sea and \\nresponsible for more of the 50% of the oxygen on Earth. \\nThey do not compete with the production of other raw mate -\\nrials, they grow in all types of water, they are extremely pro -\\nductive, and they are able to biofixate up to 2\\xa0kg of CO 2 for \\nevery kg of biomass produced.\\n Microalgae Composition\\nAs a result of their excellent biochemical profile and high \\ngrowth rates, microalgae and cyanobacteria are microscopic \\nbiofactories that generate a multitude of products of interest \\nbecause of being a natural source of proteins, fatty acids, car -\\nbohydrates, vitamins, and other compounds, such as miner -\\nals or carotenoids. Due to their rich and complete \\ncomposition, they have application in many sectors includ -\\ning agriculture, food and feed, cosmetics, aquaculture, \\nenergy, and pharmaceutical, among others (Fig.\\xa0 1).\\n Microalgae Culture\\nThe intensive and controlled culture of microalgae and cya -\\nnobacteria is developed in photobioreactors, operated to \\nobtain biomass, or extracts from it, as final product.\\nPhotobioreactor is understood as those systems in which \\nthere is a physical separation between the culture and the \\nmedium that surrounds it, normally transparent, and that \\nallows better control of the culture conditions, thus increas -\\ning productivity.\\nInside them, the division and cell growth of the cultures \\ntake place, in an efficient, sustainable, and controlled man -\\nner. Therefore, the photobioreactor, as an essential compo -nent of the production process, must be designed in \\ncompliance with a series of requirements that allow these \\npremises to be fulfilled.\\nThe main parameters to control during the development \\nof microalgae cultures are solar radiation, temperature, pH, \\nculture medium, mode of operation, including dilution rate, \\nand photobioreactor design, including mix-up.\\nOnce the culture reaches the optimum concentration \\ninside the photobioreactor, it must be harvested, which con -\\nsists of separating a part of the microalgae culture to collect \\nthe microalgae biomass contained therein, to stabilize it, and \\nprocess it based on the business application of interest \\n(Fig.\\xa0 2).\\n Results\\n AlgaEnergy Facilities\\nHaving exclusively dedicated our first 10\\xa0 years to applied \\nresearch sourcing from more than 3 decades of basic R & I, \\ntoday we can confidently say that one of the greatest accom -\\nplishments of AlgaEnergy is the successful scale-up of \\nmicroalgae cultivation processes, which allows us to put \\ninnovative, competitive, sustainable, and highly effective \\nproducts on the market.\\nAlgaEnergy owns two microalgae cultivation plants.

The focus of this chapter is on \\ncommercial products from microalgae and macroalgae. This market is estimated to be of the order of billions of dollars per year with more than 20 different com-mercial products. The largest market is food products, including nutraceuticals and functional foods. There are many refined products; in some cases, there are multiple product streams associated with the separation process. Production occurs in fresh water for some microalgae such as Spirulina. Many macroalgae are grown in salt water environments; there are both managed production systems and harvests from natural areas of seas and oceans. Because of the diversity of growth environments and species, many more potential products are possible, and additional research is to be encouraged. There are many additional locations in the world that can be used to produce beneficial products.\\nKeywords\\n \\nMacroalgae · Microalgae · Nutraceuticals · Products · Seaweeds\\nAcronymsN\\n \\nNutraceut\\nP \\nPharmaceut\\nR.

        "LLM_answer": "Yes, fucoxanthin can be economically extracted from brown algae. Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid pigment found in brown algae that has attracted attention for its potential health benefits, particularly for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Various extraction methods have been developed to efficiently extract fucoxanthin from brown algae, including solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and enzymatic extraction.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of extracting fucoxanthin from brown algae depends on several factors, including the scale of production, the extraction method used, the availability of raw algae material, and the market demand for fucoxanthin. With advancements in extraction technologies and increasing interest in natural bioactive compounds, the economic feasibility of fucoxanthin extraction from brown algae has improved in recent years.\n\nOverall, with careful optimization of extraction processes and scaling up of production, it is possible to extract fucoxanthin economically from brown algae for various applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.",

        "user_question_enriched": "Not enriched",
        "LLM_answer": "In general, seaweed cultivation and processing have been recognized as potentially carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative activities due to the ability of seaweeds to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during their growth. However, to determine the exact CO2 equivalent emissions associated with the production of 1 ton of Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) from cradle to farm gate, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study specific to the cultivation and processing of Saccharina latissima would need to be conducted. \n\nSeveral factors need to be considered in the LCA study, such as the energy sources used in cultivation and processing, transportation methods, fertilizers, and other inputs used during the production process. Additionally, the potential benefits of carbon sequestration by the seaweed during its growth phase should also be accounted for in the calculation.\n\nWithout specific data from an LCA study on the production of Saccharina latissima, it is challenging to provide an exact figure for the CO2 equivalent emissions associated with its production. I recommend referring to existing LCA studies on seaweed cultivation or collaborating with researchers in the field to conduct a specific LCA study for Saccharina latissima to determine the emissions accurately.",

Some common edible algae species that can be found in Sweden include dulse (Palmaria palmata), nori (Porphyra spp.), and sea lettuce (Ulva spp.). These can often be found attached to rocks or floating in shallow coastal waters.\n\nIf you are interested in foraging for edible algae in Sweden, it is important to do so responsibly and safely. Make sure to only harvest algae from clean, unpolluted waters, and be mindful of local regulations regarding foraging.\n\nFor more specific locations where you can find edible algae along the coast of Sweden, you may want to reach out to local marine biology research institutions or environmental organizations for guidance. Additionally, joining local foraging groups or workshops can also provide you with valuable information on where to find edible algae in Sweden.",

Brown algae are known to produce a range of \\nactive components including unique secondary metabolites \\nsuch as phlorotannins and polysaccharides, namely \\nalginic acids, laminarans, and sulfated polysaccharides \\n(fucoidans). The fucoidans are shown to be a topic of \\nnumerous studies as nontoxic compounds, possessing wide \\nspectrum of biological activities [3, 4]. The fucoidans from \\ndifferent species of brown algae have been found to inhibit \\ncarcinogenesis in variety of cancer cells, including gastric \\nadenocarcinoma [5], prostate cancer [6], melanoma [7], \\nhepatocellular carcinoma [8], breast cancer [9], and colon \\ncancer cells [10].\\nThe key molecular mechanism of anticancer effect \\nof the fucoidans is the induction of apotosis through \\ncaspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways \\n[11–14]. Moreover the fucoidans were shown to suppress \\ntumor growth by inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis \\nand metastasis [15]. The mechanism by which the \\nfucoidans inhibited these processes has not been clearly \\nelucidated. Probably, the fucoidans are responsible for \\nthe reduction of activities of Matrix Metalloproteinases \\n(MMPs) and the decrease of Vascular Endothelial Growth \\nFactor (VEGF) expression with subsequent inhibition of \\ninvasion and suppression of tubules formation in tumor \\ncells [16–18].\\nWhile the development of research efforts \\ninvolving structure of the fucoidans and their biological \\nactivities are advancing, the understanding of molecular \\nmechanisms of their action is still incomplete.

        "LLM_answer": "Contamination in a Nannochloropsis culture can be a common issue that impacts the growth and health of the algae. Here are some strategies to help address contamination in a Nannochloropsis culture:\n\n1. **Maintain sterility**: Ensure proper sterilization of equipment, culture vessels, and growth media before starting a new culture to prevent contamination from entering the system.\n\n2. **Isolation**: Isolate the contaminated culture to prevent it from spreading to other cultures. Transfer the clean cultures to new, sterilized vessels to avoid further contamination.\n\n3. **Identify the contaminant**: Identify the type of contaminant present in the culture. This could be bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms. Understanding the nature of the contamination can help in determining the most appropriate treatment method.\n\n4. **Antibiotics**: In some cases, adding antibiotics to the culture medium can help control bacterial contamination. However, it is important to use antibiotics selectively and make sure they do not harm the algae.\n\n5. **Physical separation**: Use methods such as filtration or centrifugation to physically separate the algae from contaminants like bacteria or fungi. This can help in reducing the levels of contamination in the culture.\n\n6. **Algae culture maintenance**: Ensure optimal growth conditions for the Nannochloropsis culture by providing appropriate nutrients, light, temperature, and pH levels. A healthy culture is less susceptible to contamination.\n\n7. **Regular monitoring**: Regularly monitor the cultures for any signs of contamination. Early detection can help in implementing corrective measures before the contamination spreads.\n\n8. **Culturing in a controlled environment**: Maintain the culture in a controlled environment with minimal exposure to external sources of contamination. This could include using laminar flow hoods or biosecurity protocols to minimize the risk of contamination.\n\n9. **Collaborate with other researchers**: Seek advice and collaboration with other researchers working with algae cultures. They may have experience dealing with similar contamination issues and can provide valuable insights and solutions.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively manage and reduce contamination in a Nannochloropsis culture, ensuring the health and productivity of the algae.",

Better properties were obtained in the case of brown algae, especially Undaria pinnatifida (Cofrades et\\xa0al. 2008).\\nSeaweeds are not a traditional food in the Western diet, \\ndespite occasional use as a conventional ingredient, espe-cially in coastal areas (Bouga and Combet 2015). For exam-\\nple, Fucus spiralis, Pyropia sp. and Osmundea pinnatifida \\nare consumed as food on some of the Azorean Islands, Portugal (Paiva et\\xa0al. 2014); Saccharina digitata, Saccharina \\nlatissima, Undaria pinnatifida, Himanthalia elongata, Ulva \\nsp., Gracilaria verrucosa, Palmaria palmata and Chondrus \\ncrispus in France (MacArtain et\\xa0al. 2007); and Palmaria pal-mata, Saccharina latissima, Saccharina digitata and Alaria \\nesculenta in Norway (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015; Mouritsen et\\xa0al. 2012). France was the first European country where sea-weeds were approved for human consumption (as vegetables and condiments), which opened new opportunities for the food industry. Among them, brown seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Himanthalia \\nelongata and Undaria pinnatifida; red seaweeds, Pyropia \\numbilicalis, Palmaria palmata, Chondrus crispus and \\nGracilaria verrucosa; and green seaweed, Ulva spp. (Mabeau \\nand Fleurence 1993) can be distinguished. With the recent trend towards the increasing popularity of Asian dishes (e.g. sushi) across Europe, seaweeds are being further introduced (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015). In other parts of the world, including all of the countries in tropical Latin America and most of Africa, seaweeds are an unappreciated resource that can be used for food production (FAO 2016). There are some records of the use of algae as an important ingredient in the diet of early humans in South America. In southern Chile, macroalgae have been used by the native people in food preparations like soups, stews and salads, for example, Macrocystis pyrifera, known as “huiro”, which is eaten sepa-rately; Pyropia columbina, known as “luche”, which is used \\nin soups; and Durvillaea antarctica, known as “cochayuyo”, which is eaten as a salad and in stews together with meat (Astorga-España et\\xa0al. 2017). The use of Latin American sea-weeds as an economic resource can be crucial for the wealth and sustainable livelihoods of coastal communities (Rebours et\\xa0al. 2014).\\nVery interesting research was performed by Edwards \\net\\xa0al.

These edible warm-water seaweed were first commercially cultivated in the Philippines. In the northern Philippines, the cold-water red seaweeds Porphyra atropurpurea, Pyropia vietnamensis, Halymenia formosa, and related species are also traditionally harvested from the wild and dried into black nori-like sheets called gamet which are used as ingredients in cooking.Numerous other species of seaweeds are traditionally eaten in Southeast Asia, mainly in the Philippines, but also in Indonesia (especially eastern Indonesia), Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Myanmar. These include some members of the genera Chaetomorpha, Enteromorpha, Hydroclathatrus, Padina, Sargassum, Palisada, Agardhiella, Gracilaria, Halymenia, Laurencia, Hypnea, Liagora, and Sarcodia.In the Philippines, a traditional ingredient is gulaman, which is made from agar (first attested in Spanish dictionaries in 1754) and carrageenan (first attested in c.1637) traditionally extracted mainly from Gracilaria spp. and Eucheuma spp. that grow in shallow marine coastal areas in the Philippines. In modern times, they are also mass-produced in the pioneering tropical seaweed farming industry in the country. It is also used as a substitute for gelatin. It is widely used in various traditional desserts. Carrageenan as a gelatin substitute has also spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, like in Indonesia, where it is used for desserts like es campur.\\nSeaweed is also processed into noodles by residents of Tiwi, Albay, which can be cooked into pancit canton, pancit luglug, spaghetti or carbonara.\\n\\nCommon edible seaweeds\\nCommon edible seaweeds include:\\n\\nSee also\\nAquaculture of giant kelp – Cultivation of seaweed\\nSeaweed farming – Farming of aquatic seaweed\\nSeaweed oil\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nSeaweeds used as human food an FAO report', metadata={'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_seaweed', 'authors': 'Wikipedia', 'publication_date': '2024', 'title': 'Edible Seaweed'})], 'question': 'Where can I find edible algae at the coast of Sweden?\\r\\n'}\r\n\r\n        Question: Where can I find edible algae at the coast of Sweden?",

The effort in successfully growing, harvesting microalgae and extracting for biodiesel and other products have been in practice for decades.

These types of photosynthet -\\nic microorganisms are common in open ponds cultivation which does not require \\nexpensive cleaning or sterilization processes.\\nPhotobioreactors are usually made of optically clear materials (e.g., glass or \\nacrylic) which do not allow themselves to sterilization by steam, and the size of most \\nphotobioreactors go over what can be settled in an autoclave. It could be possible to use systems with ozone for sterilization, but they are expensive and difficult to use. Therefore sanitization rather than sterilization is recommended, which can be easily performed with bleach. Air pumps, analyzers, and other equipment can be kept free of other microorganisms by the use of the proper prefilters. (Behrens 2005).\\nIn the Large-scale photobioreactor, the disinfection and sterilization can be done \\nwith solutions containing peroxyacetic acid (5\\n %, 20\\n \\nmin) or chlorine which is an \\noxidizing agent (sodium hypochlorite). The choice of sodium hypochlorite is due to the fact that it is cheap, effective, and it is also possible to neutralize the residual chlorite solution with sodium thiosulfate (Na\\n2S2O3), if necessary. According to De \\nBeer et\\n \\nal. (1994), sterilization should be performed after assembly of all compo-\\nnents of the reactor through the circulation of chlorine-based solutions. Finally, the PBR was washed with distilled water several times to remove organic and inorganic residues. At the end, the system was emptied and left to dry.\\nIn mixotrophic and heterotrophic cultivation, mainly, the culture medium must \\nalso be sterilized. Two general methods are filter sterilization and steaming. Filter sterilization is effective for small volumes or for heat-sensitive components such as vitamins. Steam sterilization of culture medium is more common. The culture medium can be either sterilized and aseptically transferred to the vessel or sterilized in the vessel (Quesnel 1987; Demain and Davies 1999).\\n4  Scaling-up and Final Considerations\\nWhen thinking about developing a microalgal production, the starting point may be the selection of an appropriate and commercially suitable algal strain. It can be per -\\nformed in small volumes laboratory cultures. The emphasis of this step have to be addressed for optimization of medium composition and culture conditions, analyses of biomass chemical composition, development of product analysis methods and harvesting process, and finally, extraction procedures. Particular interesting photo-synthetic micro-organisms are those that grow under particular or stress conditions, which helps in the cultivation in large scale.\\nWhen the optimization in the laboratory scale is successfully concluded and \\nthe microalgal strain is suitable for being produced in a large scale, the next step is the scale up, either in open ponds or in closed photobioreactor. If preferred, it can be done in small outdoor units, before going to larger ones. Moreover, it should be mentioned that if the desired product is a high value compound produced by the microalgae and it is released to the medium, it is worth evaluating the possibility', metadata={'authors': 'Rakesh Bajpai, A.A.

        "LLM_answer": "In cold regions, growing algae can be a challenging task due to the low temperatures that can hinder their growth. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to cultivate algae in such conditions:\n\n1. Selection of cold-tolerant algae species: Choose algae species that are naturally adapted to cold temperatures and can thrive in cooler environments. Some examples of cold-tolerant algae include Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis sp., and Spirulina platensis.\n\n2. Temperature control: Maintain the optimum temperature range for algae growth by using insulated tanks or ponds, and if necessary, utilizing heaters or geothermal energy to keep the temperature within the ideal range (usually between 15-25°C for most algae species).\n\n3. Light exposure: Ensure that algae cultures receive sufficient light exposure, as photosynthesis is crucial for their growth. In cold regions where sunlight may be limited, supplemental lighting such as LED grow lights can be used to provide the necessary light intensity.\n\n4. Nutrient availability: Make sure that algae are provided with essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and micronutrients to support their growth. In colder environments, nutrient availability may be lower due to reduced microbial activity, so additional nutrients may need to be added to the culture medium.\n\n5. Carbon dioxide supplementation: Algae require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, so consider supplementing the culture with CO2 to enhance growth rates, especially in cold regions where CO2 levels may be lower.\n\n6. Insulation and protection: Provide insulation for algae cultivation systems to minimize heat loss and protect the cultures from extreme cold temperatures and frost damage.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to grow algae in cold regions and harness their potential for various applications such as biofuel production, wastewater treatment, and nutraceuticals.",

        "user_question_enriched": "Not enriched",
        "LLM_answer": "Saccharina latissima, also known as sugar kelp, is a brown algae species. The carbon content in algae can vary depending on the species, environmental conditions, and growth stage. On average, algae is known to contain approximately 40-50% carbon by dry weight.\n\nFresh weight typically contains between 10-20% dry matter, with the rest being water. Based on this, we can estimate that 1 ton (1000 kg) of fresh weight Saccharina latissima might contain around 100-200 kg of dry matter.\n\nAssuming an average carbon content of 45% in the dry matter of Saccharina latissima, we can estimate the carbon content in 1 ton (1000 kg) of fresh weight Saccharina latissima:\n\n1000 kg (fresh weight) x 0.15 (dry matter percentage) x 0.45 (carbon content percentage in dry matter) = 67.5 kg\n\nSo, approximately 67.5 kg of carbon might be contained in 1 ton of fresh weight Saccharina latissima.",

These are unusual in the Baltic Sea in several re-\\nspects, making it a unique environment for studying\\nphytosociological patterns (Weinberger et al. 2020). The\\nsalinity of the Baltic Sea has changed drastically several\\ntimes since its formation after the last ice age. It is now\\ncharacterized by a gradient from 33 (Danish area of the\\nKattegat) to 4 (Northeastern Baltic Sea) (Cato and Kjellin1992). Moreover, while the Sea does not exhibit signi ﬁcant\\ntides, it features irregular variations on the surface level\\ndetermined by wind and atmospheric pressure (Rönnbäck\\net al. 2007). A third important factor in the Southwestern\\nBaltic Sea is the limited availability of hard substrata\\n(Eriksson and Johansson 2003; Weinberger et al. 2020).\\nThese speci ﬁc characteristics in ﬂuence algal community\\ncomposition along with other common factors, such as\\nseasonally varying light availability and temperature,water movement (Sheperd and Womersley 1981), and wave\\nexposure (Hurd 2000; Schanz et al. 2002).Like other habitats, however, the Baltic Sea is not a static\\nenvironment, and human activities in particular have\\nalready led to significant changes in the occurrence of algal\\nspecies. Such processes of marine community trans-\\nformation need to be studied, but this is not possible without\\nclassification of the vegetation. An important anthropogenic\\nfactor in this context is the relatively high eutrophication of\\nthe Baltic Sea, which has favored increased growth of fila-mentous and opportunistic annual algae in particular during\\nthe last 60 years (Cederwall and Elmgren 1990; Weinberger\\net al. 2020). Climate change, which has been ongoing for\\nseveral decades, may also affect macrophytes in the supra-\\nlittoral and upper sublittoral because it leads to less frequent\\nice formation in winter and more frequent heat waves in\\nsummer (Reusch et al. 2018). A third important anthropo-\\ngenic factor is invasions by alien species, which are also\\nincreasingly observed in the Baltic Sea and may transform\\nexisting associations (Thomsen et al. 2007).', metadata={'authors': 'Dmitry F.

These algae can be found in polar regions like the high Arctic, Antarctica, and alpine regions. Additionally, providing the algae with suitable nutrients and ensuring proper conditions for photosynthesis can support algae growth in cold temperatures.",

It is a very important part of \\ndiet in western countries (America, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, South Africa \\nand U.K) as well as oriental countries (China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and \\nPhilippines). In the coastal countries seaweeds are also popular as sea vegetables. \\nWithin brown seaweeds  Durvillaea, Ecklonia, Fucus, Hizikia, Lamianria   (kombu) \\nand  Undaria   (wakame) are consumed as food (Chapman  1970   and Sahoo   2000  ).\\nThey are consumed raw or cooked as salads, soups, sushi, pickles, porridge, jelly, \\njam and toasted form while used as condiments in biscuits, snacks and tea etc. \\nSeaweeds have gained popularity due to their high nutritive value. They are rich in \\nprotein, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and amino acids etc. \\n9.1.1     Animal Feed \\n Brown algae have been used as feed for a long time. According to Spolaore et al. \\n( 2006  ) about 5–10 % algae can be used safely as partial replacement for conven-\\ntional proteins in poultry feed. They are also used to feed horses, cows and pigs. In \\nmaritime districts many seaweeds such as  Sargassum  ,  Fucus  ,  Laminaria  , \\n Ascophyllum  ,  Alaria   also known as cow weed in Norway,  Chorda  ,  Pelvetia  , \\n Hormosira   are also used as feed (Chapman  1970  ).   \\n9.2     Industrial Usage \\n9.2.1     Algin and Alginates \\n The salts of algenic acid composed of L-guluronic acid monomers and D-guluronic \\nacid polymers are known as alginates. Algin is the term used for products derived \\nfrom alginic acid. Brown macroalge such as  Ascophyllum  ,  Laminaria  ,  Macrocystis  , \\n Durvellia  ,  Sargassum  ,  Cystoseira   and  Ecklonia   etc (Sahoo  2000  ; Radmer  1996   and \\nDhargalkar and Pereira  2005  ) are the major source of alginates. They are mainly \\nused in food industry (frozen food, syrups, pastry, pudding, pies, salad and dressing, \\nbeer, milk shakes and meat ﬂ  avor), paper industry (Verma  2010  ), explosives, pol-\\nishes, ceramics, toys and various others due to their water holding, emulsifying, \\ngelling and stabilizing properties (Sahoo  2000   and Radmer  1996  ). About half of the \\nconsumption of algin is in the making of ice cream and other dairy products. Also, \\nthe water-retaining properties of algin are utilized in a variety of ways in the baking \\nindustry, including the addition of algin to frostings to prevent undue drying. The \\ncolloidal nature of algin makes it useful as a suspending and emulsifying agent. In \\nthe rubber industry, it is used as a creaming and stabilizing agent in the processing \\nof natural and synthetic rubber latex. When added to paints, alginates keep the pig-\\nments in suspension and make a product that can be brushed on a surface without P.

Taste and Texture: Brown algae can have a strong, briny taste and tough, chewy texture, which may not be appealing to all consumers. This can limit its use in various culinary applications.\n\n2. Processing Challenges: Brown algae can be challenging to process into food products due to its high fiber content and tough cell walls. This can make it more difficult and time-consuming to extract the desired components for food production.\n\n3. Seasonality: Brown algae growth is highly dependent on environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability, leading to seasonality in availability. This can limit the consistent supply of brown algae for food production throughout the year.\n\n4. Nutrient Content: While brown algae are rich in certain nutrients like iodine and minerals, they may not be as nutrient-dense as other types of algae such as spirulina or chlorella. This can limit their appeal as a superfood or functional food ingredient.\n\n5. Allergenic Potential: Some individuals may have allergies to brown algae or specific components present in them, such as iodine. This can restrict the consumption of brown algae-based products among certain consumer groups.\n\nOverall, while brown algae have many potential benefits for food use, there are some limitations that need to be considered when incorporating them into the diet or developing food products.",

According to Spolaore et al. \\n( 2006  ) about 5–10 % algae can be used safely as partial replacement for conven-\\ntional proteins in poultry feed. They are also used to feed horses, cows and pigs. In \\nmaritime districts many seaweeds such as  Sargassum  ,  Fucus  ,  Laminaria  , \\n Ascophyllum  ,  Alaria   also known as cow weed in Norway,  Chorda  ,  Pelvetia  , \\n Hormosira   are also used as feed (Chapman  1970  ).   \\n9.2     Industrial Usage \\n9.2.1     Algin and Alginates \\n The salts of algenic acid composed of L-guluronic acid monomers and D-guluronic \\nacid polymers are known as alginates.

About half of the \\nconsumption of algin is in the making of ice cream and other dairy products. Also, \\nthe water-retaining properties of algin are utilized in a variety of ways in the baking \\nindustry, including the addition of algin to frostings to prevent undue drying.

This reflects their different metabolic pathways.They have cellulose walls with alginic acid and also contain the polysaccharide fucoidan in the amorphous sections of their cell walls. A few species (of Padina) calcify with aragonite needles.In addition to alginates, fucoidan and cellulose, the carbohydrate composition of brown algae consists of mannitol, laminarin and glucan.The photosynthetic system of brown algae is made of a P700 complex containing chlorophyll a. Their plastids also contain chlorophyll c and carotenoids (the most widespread of those being fucoxanthin).Brown algae produce a specific type of tannin called phlorotannins in higher amounts than red algae do.\\n\\nImportance and uses\\nBrown algae include a number of edible seaweeds. All brown algae contain alginic acid (alginate) in their cell walls, which is extracted commercially and used as an industrial thickening agent in food and for other uses. One of these products is used in lithium-ion batteries. Alginic acid is used as a stable component of a battery anode. This polysaccharide is a major component of brown algae, and is not found in land plants.\\nAlginic acid can also be used in aquaculture. For example, alginic acid enhances the immune system of rainbow trout. Younger fish are more likely to survive when given a diet with alginic acid.Brown algae including kelp beds also fix a significant portion of the earth's carbon dioxide yearly through photosynthesis. Additionally, they can store a great amount of carbon dioxide which can help us in the fight against climate change.Sargachromanol G, an extract of Sargassum siliquastrum, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.\\n\\nEdible brown algae\\nSee also\\nWrack (seaweed)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nMonterey Bay Flora\\nThe Monterey Formation of California, University of California Museum of Paleontology\\nPhaeophyceae, National University of Ireland, Galway\", metadata={'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae', 'authors': 'Wikipedia', 'publication_date': '2024', 'title': 'Brown Algae'})], 'question': 'what are the limitations of brown algae for food use\\r\\n'}\r\n\r\n        Question: what are the limitations of brown algae for food use",

Out of 47 seaweed-based products, listed in the review by Sharma et\\xa0 al., more than 50% contain extracts made out of Ascophyllum nodosum. Other species that are used for the manufacturing of plant growth stimulants are Fucus spp., Laminaria spp., Sargassum spp. and Turbinaria spp. Brown algae are a good substrate for production, as they can reach notable sizes, are available throughout the year and can be cultivated if the natural resources are all spent. Kappaphycus alvarezii is an example of red algae that have been used in the production of biostimulants. In lab-oratory-scale experiments, Ulva spp. (green algae) are commonly used as the substrate biomass for preparation of extracts (Table\\xa09.1).\\nMost of the products of this kind are derived from Asia, \\nthe United Kingdom, Brittany in France, near South Africa’s western coast, the coastal regions of Norway, the United States or Canada, because of the great availability of the raw material and its good processing properties (Sharma et\\xa0 al. 2014).\\n9.5  Direct or Indirect Stimulation of\\xa0Plant \\nGrowth Conditioned by\\xa0the\\xa0Method \\nof\\xa0Algal Extracts Application\\nDue to the diversity of active compounds present in seaweed \\ncells, the growth and development of cultivated plants can be affected in two ways. Seaweed extracts or products containing such ingredients have a positive impact on crop plants, not only because of the direct stimulation of their growth and metabolisms, e.g. nutrient uptake, but also indirectly, through improvement of the soil condition (hydration, structure) or enhancement of the number of soil microorganisms resulting from the creation of favourable conditions for their development. Products containing algal extracts not only stimulate the growth and development of crops, thus increasing the yield, but also improve their quality and nutri-tional values (Battacharyya et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nFor laboratory tests evaluating the effect of new agricul-\\ntural products, several species of plant possessing certain features are usually chosen. The preliminary tests are usually carried out on model plants like Arabidopsis thaliana or \\nother plants with a very fast growth rate. Sometimes, plants of high economic importance, or those that are the basic source of nutrients for big populations and that grow in envi-ronments with significant climatic changes, are chosen.\\nIn most studies describing tests on plants, the first step \\nconsists of assessment of the application method for a new biostimulating product, e.g. algal extract. Several methods are usually utilized, such as seed treatment, foliar spraying, soil enrichment, soil drenching (before or after sowing) or a combination of these. Also, the concentration, volume and number of doses must be adjusted before supplementing the plants in the fields. In many cases, the field experiments do not reflect the laboratory tests, since under field conditions, the combination of all of these factors may mitigate the beneficial effects of the applied biostimulator, and thus the significant results are not obtained in some cases.\\nThe impact is determined by comparing the following', metadata={'authors': 'Katarzyna Chojnacka, Piotr Paweł Wieczorek, Grzegorz Schroeder, Izabela Michalak (Editors)  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'page': 107.0, 'publication_date': '2018', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'title': 'Algae Biomass: Characteristics and Applications Towards Algae-based Products  '}), Document(page_content='Jiksing et al.

Table  1 summarizes the studies on \\nusing biostimulants and PGRs in seaweed cultivation to \\nachieve different types of culture, namely callus induc -\\ntion, and direct regeneration. \\nAMPEP and seaweed extracts\\nThe use of seaweed extracts as biostimulant applica -\\ntions in marine agronomy and to benefit increase the \\ngrowth of other cultivated seaweeds, including eucheu -\\nmatoids and other species, is currently underway and \\ngaining traction in the seaweed propagation industry \\n(Hurtado and Critchley 2018). AMPEP , a biostimulant \\nmade from Ascophyllum nodosum  extract, is one of the \\nmost widely used biostimulants for seaweed cultivation \\n(Hurtado et al. 2009). Cokrowati et al. (2017) also re -\\nported the use of various seaweed extracts, such as Ulva  \\nsp., Sargassum  sp., and Turbinaria  sp., to enhance the \\ngrowth of eucheumatoid seaweeds. AMPEP was reported \\nto minimize the attachment of epiphytes ( Cladophora  \\nsp., Ulva  sp., and Polysiphonia  subtilissima ) and their \\ndamaging activities in K. alvarezii  farming (Loureiro et \\nal. 2010). Another study showed that AMPEP-treated K. \\nalvarezii  seedlings had significantly lower Neosiphonia  \\nsp. infestation after out-planting in the ocean farm than \\nuntreated seedlings (Borlongan et al. 2011). By immers -\\ning K. alvarezii  in AMPEP solution before practical epi -\\nphyte introduction and oxidative burst induction, AM -\\nPEP was reported to have a “vaccine-like” effect on K. \\nalvarezii  and minimize the oxidative burst effect on the \\nthallus (Loureiro et al. 2012). AMPEP-treated K. alvarezii \\ngrew faster, produced more carrageenan, and had a lower \\noxidative burst effect (bleaching) than untreated K. alva -\\nrezii . Loureiro et al. (2012) also speculate on the ability \\nof AMPEP to inhibit the oxidative burst effect due to the \\npresence of betaine in the biostimulant. Aside from Kap -\\npaphycus  species, Umanzor et al. (2019) discovered that \\nAMPEP improved the growth and thermal tolerance of \\nSaccharina  latissima  and Saccharina angustissima  culti -\\nvars in a preliminary investigation. Dawange and Jaiswar \\n(2020) also reported a substantial decrease in antioxi -\\ndant response in Gracilaria cortica  treated with AMPEP , \\nsuggesting that this biostimulant possesses potent anti -\\noxidant properties. However, the specific components of \\nAMPEP that prevent epiphyte infestation and oxidative of micropropagules regenerated from K. alvarezii callus \\nto specimens farmed in India. The study found that the \\nmicropropagules restored from the callus have a higher \\ngrowth rate than the conventionally farmed samples. \\nMany factors contribute to callus formation from seaweed \\nexplants, including temperature, light, and PGRs such as \\nauxin and cytokinin used during the tissue culture pro -\\ncess (Uji et al. 2016). The seaweed callus may also be used \\nto induce somatic embryos. A study by Mo et al. (2020) \\nshows that somatic embryos can be obtained by culturing \\nKappaphycus striatus callus in a semi-solid PES medium \\nsupplemented with 1 mg L-1 1-naphthaleneacetic acid \\n(NAA) and 2 mg L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). These \\nsomatic embryos were cultured in cool white fluorescent \\ntubes with a light intensity of 55 µmol m-2 s-1 to form new \\nplantlets. However, not all seaweeds are sui table  for cal -\\nlus induction. Ramlov et al.

Agricultural formulations containing algae extracts \\nstimulate the growth and yield of plants in a very efficient way, because of their efficacy at low \\nconcentrations. Concentration of phytohormones depends mostly on the botanical origin of the obtained biomass, time and place of its collection, and the method of extraction of the active compounds. Currently, legislation restricts the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides and thus forces new approaches for reducing the use of chemical products, either by parallel application or partial replacement with enhanced formulations. Among natural materials of such capability, there are algae that contain a variety of biologically active compounds verified to have a beneficial influence on plants. Depending on their formulation, algae-based products may show the functionality of organic fertilizers or components of organo-mineral fertilizers, soil amendments (improvers), (bio)stimulants, and pesticides. Consumers expect that with the increase in food products, their quality will also improve. This is especially evident in the livestock sector, as the demand for animal protein is systematically increasing. This situation led to a search for innovative products of natural origin that could be used in animal husbandry and breeding. That product could be algae, which contain such ingredients in its biomass that have a positive impact on animal and human organisms. Not only can algae-based feed additives improve production parameters and animal health, but they can also affect the quality of animal products. In Chap. 12, the authors present the use of biomass, as well as extracts \\nderived from said biomass, from the economic and life cycle assessment perspectives. The economic aspects of obtaining algae biomass in the product life cycle are discussed with regard to the bioproducts industry.\\nProcessing algae biomass begins in the environment, is dictated by the variability of species, \\nand ends with the use of the product, whether it is biodiesel, algae cream, growth stimulant, or animal feed ingredient.\\nWe hope this book will be useful for academia, industry, and agriculture, as well as for those \\nwho work in sustainable development and ecology and are responsible for shaping the environment for recreation and leisure.

Alaria esculenta, also known as winged kelp, is a type of brown algae that is commonly studied for its nutritional composition and potential food applications.\n\nThe drip loss in Alaria esculenta during freezing and thawing can vary depending on factors such as the freezing method, storage conditions, and the specific composition of the algae itself. Generally, drip loss from Alaria esculenta during freezing and thawing is expected to be relatively low compared to animal-based products like meat, due to the different cellular structures and composition of algae.\n\nIn terms of the contents of drip loss from Alaria esculenta during freezing and thawing, it may include water, soluble proteins, sugars, minerals, and other soluble compounds present in the algae. These components can contribute to the overall nutritional value of the algae and may influence its sensory qualities as well.\n\nIf you are conducting research on drip loss in Alaria esculenta, it would be important to conduct specific experiments to measure the actual drip loss and analyze the composition of the dripped liquid to determine the exact contents. This can provide valuable insights into the quality changes that may occur during freezing and thawing processes and contribute to the understanding of how to best preserve the nutritional and sensory qualities of Alaria esculenta.",

The\\nnorthern Baltic Sea was later colonised following a coastal\\npathway along the south eastern region (Zillén et al. 2008).\\nColonisation of new areas is generally characterised by\\nrecurrent founder effects and genetic bottlenecks; resulting\\nin decreased genetic variation but also potentially in\\ndistinctive allele frequency patterns. Thus, the establish-\\nment of new F. vesiculosus populations within the Baltic\\nSea has presumably left distinct colonisation characteris-\\ntics compared to the ancestral Atlantic population.\\nPopulations of F. vesiculosus have also experienced\\nrapid declines during the 1970s and 1980s in coastal\\nzones of Estonia (Kukk and Martin 1992; Martin 2000),\\nFinland (Haahtela 1984; Kangas et al. 1982; Rönnberg\\n1984; Rönnberg et al. 1985), Germany (Vogt and Schramm\\n1991), Lithuania (Olenin and Klovaité 1998), Poland\\n(Plinski and Florczyk 1984), and Sweden (Engkvist et al.\\n2000; Kautsky et al. 1986; Lindvall 1984; Nilsson et al.\\n2004; Rosemarin et al. 1986). Population recovery has not\\noccurred over much of the species distribution, includingin some parts of Finland (Snickars et al. 2014), Germany\\n(Fürhaupter et al. 2008), and Sweden (Nilsson et al. 2004).\\nMoreover, in some areas of the Archipelago Sea, a continued\\ndecline of F. vesiculosus has been reported (Vahteri and\\nVuorinen 2016). Conversely, local recovery or expansions\\nhave occurred in other parts of Sweden (Engkvist et al. 2002;\\nEriksson et al. 1998; Nilsson et al. 2004) and Finland\\n(Kangas and Niemi 1985; Rönnberg et al. 1985).\\nAccordingly, the Baltic Sea F. vesiculosus population\\nhas undergone both recent and historic demographic\\nchanges that may dramatically affect the genetic structureand diversity of the population. However, the effects\\nof these demographic chan ges when considering both\\nforms concurrently are poorly understood. This study\\ninvestigated the genetic structure and demographic\\nhistory of both forms of F. vesiculosus within the Baltic\\nSea using mitochondrial mar kers. There is no universally\\naccepted DNA barcoding marker for brown algae,\\nwith barcodes often selected depending on the genus\\nstudied (Bartolo et al. 2020). Consequently the mostinformative marker currently available for Fucus ,t h e\\nmitochondrial (mtDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS), was\\nselected alongside the lower resolution mtDNA 23Ssubunit region (Coyer et al. 2006a). The study aimed to\\nidentify phylogeographic patterns within the Baltic pop-\\nulation, particularly those relating to the intraspeci ﬁc\\nrelationships between forms.

This section focuses on the vast majority of these types, \\nmentioning examples, with the advantages and disadvantages of each system. The \\nbiomass yield varies widely based on the system used (Table 1). It is worth to \\nmention that these types are not completely separated from each other, but it is possible to ﬁnd a speciﬁc design for seaweed cultivation that includes a mixture of \\nmore than one type. Algae Cultivation Systems 17\\n2.3.1 Floating Design \\nThe idea of free-ﬂoating seaweed cultivation imitates their natural environment and \\nhabitats. As a result, it does not only prevent the permanent occupation of coastal \\nspace, but also saves money that would be spent on expensive buildings and the potential loss of large algae caused by strong current and wave forces during storms. \\nUnderstanding possible pathways for free-ﬂoating seaweed cultivation in the coastal ocean is essential. A difﬁcult job that has traditionally been taken into consideration \\nto prevent marine debris, such as plastics from attaching to the seaweeds and \\ntracking ﬂoating objects in the ocean (Van Sebille et al. \\n2020 ) and oil spills (Liu \\net al. 2011 ). Global drifting networks have been employed by researchers \\n(Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham 1994 ), including satellite measurements (Mulet et al. \\n2012 ), models, and even accidental spills, to map out the seasonality of global \\ncurrents and changes in seaweeds. The capacity to foresee potential algal biomass yield along the ﬂoating technology is crucial for achieving a large-scale and ﬁscally \\nfeasible seaweed production method. The seaweed growth model that includes \\nenvironmental elements like light, temperature, and nutrition information for bio-\\nmass growth prediction can be utilized when combined with the trajectory model for \\nmaximum biomass yield. The ideal time and location for discharge and collection of \\nseaweeds may then be determined using this model (Brooks et al. \\n2018 ). \\n2.3.2 S ubmerged S ystems \\nAnchor farms in coastal areas are the traditional method of cultivating seaweeds, \\nwhere seaweeds are supported by long cultivation ropes and other structures.

It permits cultivation \\nof a greater number of species, ensures domination of selected species, and extends the vegetation period; if the pond is heated, the vegetation period can last all year round. Idle lands are perfect areas for algae cultivation. It is also possible to use wastewater for algae production, with the wastewater then also being purified of nitrogen and phospho-rus compounds. This is a very promising solution for reduc-tion of cost related to water and nutrient supply. Algae biomass can be collected from the water by the following methods:\\n –With the use of a special platform\\n –With the use of foam flotation\\n –By filtration through cellulose membranes with the use of a vacuum pump\\n –With the use of flocculation and centrifugation\\n –With the use of magnetite (iron oxide) particles of micro-metric size\\nThe process of biomass production of final energy and non- energy products can be divided into several stages:\\n –Collection of algae biomass\\n –Cleaning of coatings and diatoms, washing with water, and air-drying\\n –Storage or milling of biomass\\n –Extraction of algae biomass by various techniques\\n –Extract processing, chemical isolation of bioactive com-pounds, and management of the extracted biomass\\nIn this compilation, transport of the biomass and the prod-ucts obtained through its processing is not included.\\nThe alternative to algae cultivation in open ponds is the \\nuse of closed photobioreactors. The best seem to be the pho-tobioreactors that use solar radiation. These reactors are made of light-transmitting materials (Molina et\\xa0 al. 1999; Pulz 2001). There are three main types of photobioreactor: \\nvertical column, cylindrical, and flat panel. The fast growth of algae requires long exposure to intensive sunlight and a temperature no lower than 20\\xa0°C; under other conditions, the growth of the algae will be inhomogeneous and ineffective. In some algae cultivation plants, water is heated, and addi-tional light sources are used, which increases the cost of bio-mass production. Such reactors are used for cultivation of algae to be used for the production of cosmetics and medical products. The additional cost of lighting is calculated into the price of the special product (Saeid and Chojnacka 2015).\\nPhotobioreactors offer high rates of productivity, with the \\npotential to yield 5000–15,000\\xa0gal of microalgal oil per acre per year. If an average yield of 10,000\\xa0gal of oil /acre/year could be achieved, the 63 billion gallon diesel demand of the USA could be produced on just 6.3 million acres (Oil seed crops 2016).\\nThe yield of biodiesel production from algae is 15–300 \\ntimes higher than that of oil produced from traditional crops. The yield of various plant oils (gallons per hectare) is soy 118, safflower 206, sunflower 251, castor 373, coconut 605, palm 605, and algae 26,417. The yield of oils per hectare of algae crops is high, higher than that for oilseeds (Biodigester 2016).\\nBioproducts can be produced from different types of alga \\nand through the use of different technologies. Microalgae contain the oil that is suitable for biodiesel production. Production of bioethanol mainly involves macroalgae, which are characterized by a high content of starch and cellulose, including brown algae, red algae, and chara (charophytes). Depending on the type of alga and the type of metabolism, these organisms accumulate different storage materials in their cells: lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. Oil can be obtained from algae by pressing or by extraction, while the species rich in proteins or saccharides are used for alcoholic fermentation of methane production. Recently, algae have been frequently mentioned as a potential source of hydrogen or methanol for fuel cells.\\nThe cost-effectiveness of biodiesel production from algae', metadata={'authors': 'Katarzyna Chojnacka, Piotr Paweł Wieczorek, Grzegorz Schroeder, Izabela Michalak (Editors)  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'page': 139.0, 'publication_date': '2018', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'title': 'Algae Biomass: Characteristics and Applications Towards Algae-based Products  '})], 'question': 'What is the maximum annual biomass production of algae per hectare?\\r\\n'}\r\n\r\n        Question: What is the maximum annual biomass production of algae per hectare?",

Agricultural formulations containing algae extracts \\nstimulate the growth and yield of plants in a very efficient way, because of their efficacy at low \\nconcentrations. Concentration of phytohormones depends mostly on the botanical origin of the obtained biomass, time and place of its collection, and the method of extraction of the active compounds. Currently, legislation restricts the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides and thus forces new approaches for reducing the use of chemical products, either by parallel application or partial replacement with enhanced formulations. Among natural materials of such capability, there are algae that contain a variety of biologically active compounds verified to have a beneficial influence on plants. Depending on their formulation, algae-based products may show the functionality of organic fertilizers or components of organo-mineral fertilizers, soil amendments (improvers), (bio)stimulants, and pesticides. Consumers expect that with the increase in food products, their quality will also improve. This is especially evident in the livestock sector, as the demand for animal protein is systematically increasing. This situation led to a search for innovative products of natural origin that could be used in animal husbandry and breeding. That product could be algae, which contain such ingredients in its biomass that have a positive impact on animal and human organisms. Not only can algae-based feed additives improve production parameters and animal health, but they can also affect the quality of animal products. In Chap. 12, the authors present the use of biomass, as well as extracts \\nderived from said biomass, from the economic and life cycle assessment perspectives. The economic aspects of obtaining algae biomass in the product life cycle are discussed with regard to the bioproducts industry.\\nProcessing algae biomass begins in the environment, is dictated by the variability of species, \\nand ends with the use of the product, whether it is biodiesel, algae cream, growth stimulant, or animal feed ingredient.\\nWe hope this book will be useful for academia, industry, and agriculture, as well as for those \\nwho work in sustainable development and ecology and are responsible for shaping the environment for recreation and leisure.

Legal regulations: Seaweed harvesting is regulated in many countries, and \\nobtaining the necessary permits and licenses can be a time-consuming process. \\nHarvesting without proper authorization can result in ﬁnes and legal conse-\\nquences. Also, information on seaweed harvest regulations and management \\nvary from country to country. Findings showed that existing harvest management \\nand regulation plans for most countries are often sketchy without sufﬁcient \\ndetails. Most countries utilize some form of single-species harvest management \\npractice. Such management focus on the regeneration of the seaweed resource \\nitself, with limited or no consideration of other species that are associated with the \\ntarget species and are often affected by bycatch or habitat loss and alterations. \\nHowever, few countries outlaw seaweed harvesting in areas important to other \\nspecies, such as in seabird protection areas in Norway. \\n3. Environmental constraints: Seaweed harvesting can have environmental impacts, \\nand in some cases, it may not be permitted in sensitive marine ecosystems or \\nprotected areas. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as storms or strong \\ncurrents, can prevent or limit seaweed harvesting. \\n4. Seasonality: The growth and harves ting of some seaweed species are seasonal, \\nwhich can limit the availability of seaweeds for harvesting at certain times of \\nthe year. \\n5. Infrastructure: Some seaweed harvesting methods, such as farming or mechan-\\nical harvesting, require specialized infrastructure such as moorings, buoys, or \\nboats. The construction and maintenance of such infrastructure can be costly. \\n6. Availability: The availabilit y of seaweeds can be a constraint, especially for \\nspecies that are rare or only grow in speciﬁc locations. In some cases, the \\navailability of seaweeds may not be sufﬁcient to support large-scale harvesting. \\n4 Conclusions \\nVarious methods of harvesting algae, their economic feasibility, environmental \\nimpacts, and possible constraints have been identiﬁed and discussed in this chapter. \\nThe lack of efﬁcient and sustainable harvesting techniques has also been identiﬁed as a major obstacle toward the full utilization of algal biomass on an industrial scale for the production of biofuels and other value-added products.

The most commonly employed detoxiﬁcation\\nprocess include (1) physical methods such as evaporation, membrane separation,\\nion-exchange resins, and active charcoal, (2) chemical methods such as neutraliza-\\ntion, extraction via organic solvent, sugaring-out extraction, and salting-out extrac-tion, (3) biological methods such as microbial pre-treatment, microbial acclimatiza-\\ntion, in-situ microbial detoxiﬁcation via Trichoderma reesei and enzymatic clariﬁ-\\ncation, and (4) technological integration (Chandel et al. 2011 ; Kumar et al. 2020a ).\\nThe genetic engineering approaches and directed evolution methods are the latest\\napproaches to develop competitive strains having inhibitors tolerance (Fu et al. 2011 ).\\nAlso, plant genetic engineering to alter the lignocellulosic composition and ligninsyringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio are a curious practice. The change in lignin S/G ratio\\ncan reduce the syringyl-rich based recalcitrance which facilitates easy sacchariﬁca-\\ntion and low inhibitor generation (Fu et al. 2011 ; Kumar et al. 2020a ). Deshavath\\net al.

All costs can provideseaweed biomass even in countries with cold weather; Nordic countries have limitedlight levels and low temperatures that hinder ﬁrst-generation biofuels, but the vast\\ncoastlines are rich in marine biomass. For example, Saccharina latissima known for\\nits high carbohydrate content, is widely available in the warm cost and studies tohave been made for its utilization in methane production; an enzyme complex of β-1-\\n3/1–4-glucanase, cellulase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase,\\nα-˪-arabinofuranosidase was utilized to improve the reducing sugar release of\\nalkaline treated pulp for anaerobic digestion.

Among the 27 genera of macroalgae and microalgae recorded as having been eaten by the questionnaire participants, the most popu-lar were red seaweeds (60% of phycologists and 71% of the general public). Pyropia spp. were the most commonly pre-ferred. Interestingly, “lack of availability” was the main rea-son for not eating algae. It was concluded that greater information on algae and their wider availability could encourage people to include them as part of a balanced and healthy diet. It is also important to change peoples’ mindset to consider seaweeds not as weeds or wracks but rather as a very versatile and tasty kind of food source (Mouritsen 2017).\\nThe problem for people who do not consume algae on a \\nhistorical basis is often the lack of enzymes required to thor -\\noughly digest dietary seaweeds. The digestive flora of a par -\\nticular person may take up to 4\\xa0 months to produce the dedicated enzymes. Therefore, it is beneficial to eat a small amount of seaweed daily rather than larger amounts occa-sionally (Dhargalkar 2014). However, the popularization of the East Asian diet worldwide has gradually increased public interest and acceptance of seaweed as a food source, partly due to their suggested health benefits. Consequently, con-sumption of seaweed and seaweed-based products is rising, similar to the trend observed with fresh fruits and vegetables (Sharifuddin et\\xa0al. 2015). In European countries, it is pro-posed that seaweeds be indirectly introduced into the human food chain through their addition to the diet of marine ani-mals (e.g. fish, shrimp) produced by aquaculture (Fleurence et\\xa0al. 2012). However, algae are also supplemented directly \\ninto the human diet in different forms: whole seaweed meal (fresh, dried\\xa0– including a dry-ground meal) and processed seaweed (seaweed extracts, bioactive seaweed compounds, homogenates, fermented seaweeds).\\nNowadays, due to continuous exposure to radiation, metal \\npoisoning, gaseous emission, radioactive substances and other pollutions, it is recommended that seaweeds be used on a daily basis, so as to supplement the diet with nutrients and biologically active compounds, detoxify the body and reduce the negative effect of environmental pollution on human health (Dhargalkar 2014). Seaweed products are also used as a substitute for the addition of salt, artificial colours and fla-vours (Pedersen et\\xa0al. 2013). According to data presented by Edwards et\\xa0 al. (2012), the main reasons given for eating algae by phycologists (N\\xa0 =\\xa0 273) and the general public (N\\xa0=\\xa0104) are health 36% vs. 13%, tradition 18% vs. 15% and taste 44% vs. 57%.\\nI.

The Propel network of gas stations \\nin San Francisco (USA) offered biodiesel with a 20% admix-ture of the component obtained from algae (Cardwell 2013). Production of algae biodiesel on a mass scale must be evalu-ated, taking into account the size of resources, their avail-ability and stability of supply, the effect on the environment and economy, the yield of technology applied, and the life cycle of the product (Quinn and Davis 2015).\\nMicroalgae are considered to be one of the most feasible \\noptions with the potential to serve as a major feedstock for biofuels and bioproduct production. However, the economic viability of commercial-scale production continues to be called into question by many researchers and investors. Biomass from micro- and macroalgae contains significant amounts of water. Microalgae generally contain only 10–15% dry matter ( Chen\\xa0et\\xa0al. 2015). Therefore, there is a need to carry out parametric analyses so as to identify the influence of system configuration and process on their eco-nomic viability. The results show that the most important cost-driving parameters are the pond, the harvesting, and the biomass drying process (Madugu and Collu 2016).\\nThe biggest challenge for any biofuel technology is the \\ndrying out of microalgae. This process is the most energy consumptive (Bennion et\\xa0al. 2015). Research on the econom-ics of using algae for biofuel production is primarily based on experiences and calculations from other climates and adapta-tion to European conditions. Malic et\\xa0 al. have established that, for the climatic zone of Australia, bio-crude production is environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. To this end, an economic multi-region input- output model of \\nAustralia was completed through processing of the engineer -\\ning data on algal bio-crude production. This model was used to undertake hybrid life-cycle assessment for direct measure-ment, as well as measuring the indirect impacts of producing bio-crude. Overall, the supply chain of bio-crude is more sus-tainable than that of conventional crude oil. The results indi-cate that producing 1 million Mg of bio- crude will generate \\nalmost 13,000 new jobs and 4 billion dollars’ worth of eco-nomic stimulus. Furthermore, bio-crude production will offer carbon. Sequestration opportunities of the production process are net carbon-negative (Malic et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nSlade and coworkers have shown three aspects of micro-\\nalgae production that will ultimately determine its future economic viability and environmental sustainability: the energy and carbon balance, environmental impacts, and pro-duction cost (Slade and Bauen 2013). We find that achieving a positive energy balance in the temperate climate of Europe will require technological advances and highly optimized production systems (Ghadiryanfar et\\xa0al. 2016).\\nBiomass of microalgae is also considered as an alternative \\nsource of bioenergy. The techno-economic characteristics of macroalgae utilization in European temperate zones was evaluated by Dave et\\xa0 al. (2013) in a selected anaerobic digester using the chemical process modeling software ECLIPSE.\\xa0The assessment covered the mass and energy bal-ance of the entire process, followed by an economic feasibil-ity study, which included the total cost estimation, net present value calculation, and sensitivity analysis. The selected plant size corresponded to a community-based AD of 1.6\\xa0 MW with a macroalgae feed rate of 8.64\\xa0Mg per day (dry basis). The produced biogas was utilized in a combined heat and power plant generating 237\\xa0kW of electricity and 367\\xa0kW of heat. The break-even electricity-selling price in this study was estimated at around €120/MWh. On the grounds of dif-ferent national and regional policies, this study did not account for any government incentives (Dave et\\xa0al. 2013).\\nAitken presented a life-cycle assessment (LCA) that con-', metadata={'authors': 'Katarzyna Chojnacka, Piotr Paweł Wieczorek, Grzegorz Schroeder, Izabela Michalak (Editors)  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'page': 137.0, 'publication_date': '2018', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-74703-3.pdf', 'title': 'Algae Biomass: Characteristics and Applications Towards Algae-based Products  '})], 'question': 'Could you give me a graph of algae consumption in Europe?\\r\\n'}\r\n\r\n        Question: Could you give me a graph of algae consumption in Europe?",

(2008) showed that meat prod-ucts formulated with the brown seaweeds (Himanthalia elongata, Undaria pinnatifida) had different characteristics \\n(water- and fat-binding properties, hardness, chewiness of the cooked products, lower springiness and cohesiveness, colour changes) from the products made with the red sea-weeds (Pyropia umbilicalis). Better properties were obtained in the case of brown algae, especially Undaria pinnatifida (Cofrades et\\xa0al. 2008).\\nSeaweeds are not a traditional food in the Western diet, \\ndespite occasional use as a conventional ingredient, espe-cially in coastal areas (Bouga and Combet 2015). For exam-\\nple, Fucus spiralis, Pyropia sp. and Osmundea pinnatifida \\nare consumed as food on some of the Azorean Islands, Portugal (Paiva et\\xa0al. 2014); Saccharina digitata, Saccharina \\nlatissima, Undaria pinnatifida, Himanthalia elongata, Ulva \\nsp., Gracilaria verrucosa, Palmaria palmata and Chondrus \\ncrispus in France (MacArtain et\\xa0al. 2007); and Palmaria pal-mata, Saccharina latissima, Saccharina digitata and Alaria \\nesculenta in Norway (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015; Mouritsen et\\xa0al. 2012). France was the first European country where sea-weeds were approved for human consumption (as vegetables and condiments), which opened new opportunities for the food industry. Among them, brown seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Himanthalia \\nelongata and Undaria pinnatifida; red seaweeds, Pyropia \\numbilicalis, Palmaria palmata, Chondrus crispus and \\nGracilaria verrucosa; and green seaweed, Ulva spp. (Mabeau \\nand Fleurence 1993) can be distinguished. With the recent trend towards the increasing popularity of Asian dishes (e.g. sushi) across Europe, seaweeds are being further introduced (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015). In other parts of the world, including all of the countries in tropical Latin America and most of Africa, seaweeds are an unappreciated resource that can be used for food production (FAO 2016). There are some records of the use of algae as an important ingredient in the diet of early humans in South America. In southern Chile, macroalgae have been used by the native people in food preparations like soups, stews and salads, for example, Macrocystis pyrifera, known as “huiro”, which is eaten sepa-rately; Pyropia columbina, known as “luche”, which is used \\nin soups; and Durvillaea antarctica, known as “cochayuyo”, which is eaten as a salad and in stews together with meat (Astorga-España et\\xa0al. 2017). The use of Latin American sea-weeds as an economic resource can be crucial for the wealth and sustainable livelihoods of coastal communities (Rebours et\\xa0al. 2014).\\nVery interesting research was performed by Edwards \\net\\xa0al. (2012), who fashioned a short questionnaire during the fourth ISAP (International Society for Applied Phycology) conference in Halifax (2011) to gather some information on the algal eating habits of the participants. It was found that 93% of the conference members (mainly phycologists, N\\xa0=\\xa0273, 35 nationalities) had previously eaten algae, as well as 64% of the general public (N\\xa0=\\xa0104, 25 nationalities).

The effects are attributed to \\ntheir prebiotic ﬁ  bres, and the beneﬁ  ts seen with higher ﬁ  bre diets. There is a product \\non the market that is speciﬁ  cally targeting weight loss. It contains  Fucus vesiculosus   \\nand is sold under the trade name Quantrim ™ . This product makes a direct claim for \\nweight loss based upon its chelated iodine content, as well as its induction of satiety \\ndue to the alginates’ hygroscopic properties (gut bulking). \\n Jamaican Irish Moss drink (marketed by Big Bamboo) is available in canned \\nformat in a variety of ﬂ  avors (e.g., peanut, banana).

There have been signiﬁ  cant events such as the \\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis,  Escherichia coli   contamination of \\nspinach and other vegetables, and considerations such as genetically modiﬁ  ed (GM) \\ncrops entering the food chain. Consumers are demanding assurances that ingredi-\\nents and raw materials are safe, and this has focused the food industry on traceabil-\\nity. Traceability relates to the origin of materials, their processing history, and the \\ndistribution chain of consumer products. A requirement of industrial food produc-\\ntion and distribution is the ability to trace a product’s history by means of recorded \\ndata (Bertolini et al.  2006  ). \\n The European Union (EU) has some of the most stringent requirements for trace-\\nability. The development of GM foods and the safety concerns of many consumers \\naround these products, led to the requirement that all GM foods be labeled as such \\nin the EU. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), deﬁ  nes “traceability” as \\nthe ability to trace or follow a food, feed, food-producing animal or substance \\nintended to be, or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed, through all stages \\nof production, processing and distribution. France was the ﬁ  rst European country \\n(1990) to establish speciﬁ  c regulations concerning the use of seaweeds for human \\nconsumption (Mabeau and Fleurence  1993  ). Under these regulations, seaweeds \\nmust meet certain consumer safety regulations for maximum allowed levels of toxic \\nminerals (lead, cadmium, tin, mercury, mineral arsenic and iodine), as well as maxi-\\nmum allowed bacterial loads. Within Europe, some countries are not subject to any \\nparticular regulations (Ireland, Denmark, The Netherlands), while in others they \\nhave not been considered food, and have been strictly forbidden (Greece).

Fucus also represents brown algae and, similarly to \\nLaminaria, grows in marine water, mostly in cold seas, including along the Baltic Sea coast (Pielesz 2010; Guiry and Guiry 2015). Fucus vesiculosus L. is most often used \\nin the cosmetics industry. Its characteristic feature is a ribbonlike thallus covered with air bladders. Algae from this species contain iodine, magnesium, manganese, zinc, vitamin C, fucoxanthin, laminarin, and fucoidan. In cos-metic products, Fucus vesiculosus is used as an additive to filters protecting against UV radiation and in anti- cellulite products. Other species of significance in cosme-tology are Fucus spiralis L. and Fucus serratus L. \\n(Debacq-Chainiaux et\\xa0al. 2006; Czerpak and Jabłońska- \\nTrypuć 2008; Pielesz 2010; D’Orazio et\\xa0al. 2012).\\n 6. Pylaiella, belonging to the group of brown algae, is char -\\nacterized by a threadlike thallus and grows mainly in cold seas (Van den Hoek et\\xa0 al. 1995; Silberfeld et\\xa0 al. 2014; Guiry and Guiry 2015). The species Pylaiella littoralis \\n(L.) Kjellman, Pylaiella ochotensis Ruprecht, Pylaiella flexilis Ruprecht, or Pylaiella seriata Kuckuck contain \\nmicroelements, vitamins, polysaccharides, alginic acid, mannitol, laminarin, fucoidan, and many other bioactive substances. Thanks to the content of its thalli, Pylaiella shows skin-moisturizing properties, is capable of skin nutrition, shows antioxidative skin-protecting and skin- revitalizing properties, and activates the skin’s metabo-lism (Blomster et\\xa0al. 2000; Czerpak and Jabłońska-Trypuć 2008; Manoylov 2014).\\n 7. Ceramium algae are red algae of multicellular, filamen-tous, and leaf-shaped thalli (Van den Hoek et\\xa0al. 1995; Blomster et\\xa0al. 2000; Guiry and Guiry 2015). They live mostly in marine waters and prefer warm climatic zones, largely remaining scarce in cold climates. They contain large amounts of amino acids, proteins, vitamins, mineral salts, and agar. A popular cosmetic raw product is Ceramium rubrum Agardh, which contains creatine-like substances, used for skin care for the hands and legs (Czerpak and Jabłońska-Trypuć 2008; Pielesz 2010). The \\nextracts from this species show antibacterial properties (Ikawa et\\xa0 al. 1973). Other important species from this genus are Ceramium circinatum (Kütz.) Agardh, Ceramium diaphanum (Lightf.) Roth, and Ceramium tenuicorne (Kütz.) Waern.\\n8.3  Algae Collection and\\xa0the\\xa0Processing \\nof\\xa0Algal Biomass\\nAlgal biomass for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical indus-\\ntries and for production of other preparations is obtained from two sources. Producers can either purchase the already- processed raw algae products from firms dealing with their cultivation and distribution, e.g., from algae farms, or they can collect algae from sites at which they naturally occur or from algae cultivation sites (Fabrowska et\\xa0al. 2015a, b; Shah \\net\\xa0al. 2016; Sebök et\\xa0al. 2017). In order to ensure the highest \\nquality, they are collected from the purest waters in Japan, Brittany, and Hawaii.

This involves providing the algae with the necessary nutrients, light, and environmental conditions to support their growth.\n\n2. **Harvesting**: Once the algae reach a certain maturity, they are harvested from the cultivation site. Harvesting can be done manually or using mechanical equipment, depending on the scale of cultivation.\n\n3. **Drying**: The harvested algae are then dried to reduce their moisture content. This step is important as it helps in preserving the algae and makes it easier to process them further.\n\n4. **Pretreatment**: The dried algae are typically subjected to pretreatment to break down their cell walls and release the sugars and lipids present in the algae. This can involve physical, chemical, or biological methods.\n\n5. **Extraction**: The sugars and lipids obtained from the pretreatment are extracted using techniques such as solvent extraction or enzymatic hydrolysis. This step separates the components that can be converted into biofuels.\n\n6. **Fermentation**: The sugars obtained from the extracted algae are fermented using microorganisms such as yeast or bacteria to produce bioethanol or other biofuels. This step converts the sugars into ethanol through the process of fermentation.\n\n7. **Distillation**: The bioethanol produced through fermentation is then distilled to remove impurities and obtain high-purity bioethanol that can be used as a fuel.\n\nThe efficiency rates of converting Saccharina latissima algae into biofuel can vary depending on various factors such as the cultivation conditions, harvesting methods, pretreatment efficiency, extraction techniques, and fermentation yield. Research studies have reported efficiency rates ranging from 20-30% for bioethanol production from seaweed biomass. However, continuous research and development efforts are underway to improve the efficiency of algae-to-biofuel conversion processes and make them more economically viable.",

Seaweed is a type of macroscopic marine algae that can be seen with the naked eye and typically grows in coastal areas. Algae, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that can be found in various aquatic environments, including both marine and freshwater habitats. While seaweed is a specific type of algae, not all algae are classified as seaweed. Algae can be single-celled microorganisms or multicellular organisms, and they play crucial roles in aquatic ecosystems as primary producers.",

A thorough\\ntechno-economic analysis is important to draw a clear correlation between algalbiofuel and other ordinary petroleum products.\\n12.5 Algae Biofuels and Conversion Process\\nAlgae biomass has a wide variety of applications. Major components of microalgae(i.e., carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) are easily converted into liquid, gas, andsolid fuel (e.g., bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biohydrogen, and syngas) through\\nthree processes. They are biochemical, chemical, and thermochemical conversion.\\nIn thermochemical conversion, the organic matter of algal biomass is broken downto produce value-added liquid, gaseous, solid fuels such as synthesis gas, carbon\\nmonoxide, and hydrogen, etc. They are mainly categorized into pyrolysis, liquefac-\\ntion, gasiﬁcation, and direct combustion. In the pyrolysis process, the feedstock in theabsence of oxygen is heated and decomposed at a deﬁnite residence time to produce\\nliquid oil, gas, and solid char. The temperature is around 400–600 °C and the pres-\\nsure is around 0.1 Mpa. When compared to the gasiﬁcation process, decompositionoccurs at much lower temperatures and helps produce liquid oil. The liquefaction\\nof biomass is a catalytic conversion process carried out at a very low temperature\\n(300–350 °C) and high pressures (5–20 MPa). Excessive moisture content in thefeedstock makes the system more suitable. Gasiﬁcation is a thermochemical trans-\\nformation of microalgal biomass into useful energy fuels like hydrogen and methane.\\nThe reaction is carried out with less oxygen and at high temperatures mainly between800 °C and 1000 °C. Gasiﬁcation is mainly classiﬁed into four stages: drying, pyrol-\\nysis, combustion, and reduction. Direct combustion is a thermochemical conversion\\ntechnique where the biomass is heated in the open air, or excess air is supplied to\\nproduce energy. High moisture content (< =50%) biomass is not suitable for this\\nprocess as a lot of energy is needed for drying. The heat generated can be utilizedfor drying and grinding microalgae reducing additional costs for the process (Yang\\net al. 2011 ).\\nBiochemical conversion is a decomposition process where biomass is broken\\ndown using enzymes of bacteria or other microorganisms through anaerobic diges-\\ntion, fermentation, and photobiological techniques.

Fungal endophytes: These are fungi that live within the tissues of the algae without causing harm. They can provide benefits to the algae, such as increased tolerance to stress and enhanced growth.\n\n3. Diatoms: These are a type of algae that often grow in association with Saccharina latissima. Diatoms can contribute to the overall diversity and ecosystem function of the algae culture.\n\n4. Heterotrophic bacteria: These bacteria break down organic matter in the environment and may play a role in nutrient recycling within the cultivation system.\n\nOverall, the microbial community associated with cultivated Saccharina latissima is complex and dynamic, and researchers are continuing to explore the interactions between the algae and its associated microorganisms to better understand and optimize cultivation practices.",

In addition, the EU will also\\nimplement further restrictions on the use of antibiotics for the treatment of groups of animals from\\n2022 [ 5]. Thus, identifying natural alternatives will be important if we are to maintain future animal\\ngrowth and health during the turbulent post-weaning period.\\nBrown seaweeds such as Ascophyllum nodosum are a valuable source of bioactive polysaccharides,\\nincluding laminarin, alginates, mannitol, phlorotannins and fucoidans [ 6]. Fucoidans are sulphated,\\nfucose rich polymers present in the algal cell wall [ 7]. They are chemically complex polysaccharides\\nwith varying compositions and molecular weights, but typically comprise a backbone of (1 →3)-linked\\nα-l-fucopyranosyl or of alternating (1 →3)- and (1→4)-linked α-l-fucopyranosyl residues [ 8]. Identiﬁed\\nbiological activities include antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral e ﬀects [ 9–11],\\nand as fucoidan is a non-digestible polysaccharide, it may also have prebiotic e ﬀects [ 6]. In pigs,\\nfucoidan increased lactobacilli in the caecal digesta [ 12], colonic digesta [ 13] and faeces [ 14,15] and caecal\\nand colonic butyrate concentrations [ 12]. The gastrointestinal microbiota contributes to host health\\nand growth through the fermentation of carbohydrates, production of vitamins, healthy maintenance\\nof the intestinal epithelium, immune and neural system development in neonates and protection\\nfrom opportunistic pathogenic bacteria [ 16,17]. Thus, dietary supplementation with fucoidan may\\nbeneﬁcially inﬂuence the composition of the intestinal microbiota of the newly weaned pig and thus,\\nprevent the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and the onset of post-weaning diarrhoea.\\nHowever, the polysaccharide content and composition of seaweeds vary with season, the region\\nof harvest, macroalgal species and extraction procedure [ 18,19]. Ascophyllum nodosum has been\\nreported to contain 4%–11% fucoidan, 24%–28% alginate, 5%–11% mannitol and 1%–10% laminarin [ 6].\\nWhile research is under way to develop new innovative extraction methodologies to achieve high\\nyields of puriﬁed polysaccharides, the currently used traditional extraction and puriﬁcation processes\\nare costly and ine ﬃcient in terms of energy usage and time (as reviewed by [ 20]). Thus, the ﬁrst\\nobjective of this study is to determine the e ﬀect of increasing fucoidan inclusion levels from an extract\\ncontaining 44% fucoidan from Ascophyllum nodosum on the faecal scores and large intestinal microbiota\\nof weaned pigs. It is hypothesised that the optimum inclusion level of fucoidan will enhance the\\nlarge intestinal microbiota, thereby reducing the incidence of post-weaning diarrhoea. Previously\\nincreasing dietary inclusion of an Ascophyllum nodosum extract led to a linear reduction in the daily\\ngains of grower ﬁnisher pigs associated with reduced diet digestibility [ 21]. As the digestive system of\\nthe pig is not fully developed at weaning, higher inclusion levels may negatively impact pig growth\\nperformance and small intestinal functionality due to the increased levels of non-digestible ﬁbre\\npresent (fucoidan (44%) and alginates (13.5%)). Thus, a further objective of this study is to identify the\\neﬀects of the fucoidan-rich extract on growth performance and parameters related to small intestinal\\nhealth including morphology, the expression of genes involved in nutrient digestion and absorption,\\ninﬂammation, mucus production, pathogen recognition and tight junctions.\\n2.

Fucoidan is made up  of L-fucose, sulfate groups and \\none or more small proportions of xylose,  mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, \\nglucuronic acid and acetyl groups in a variety of brown algae [13 –15].

In addition to the structure of fucoidan, there is also a variation am ongst different seaweed \\ntypes. Nevertheless, fucoidan normally has two types of homofucose ( Figure 2 ). One type (I) \\nencompasses repeated (1 →3)-L-fucopyranose, and the other type (II) encompasses alternating and \\nrepeated (1 →3)- and (1→4)-L-fucopyranose [ 16]. \\nReports based on structures of fucoidan, sourced from different species of brown algae, brought \\nabout an improved categorization in terms of structures.

A number of Fucales  species, such as Fucus \\nserratus , Fucus distichus  and Pelvetia canaliculate , present  similar  fucoidan backbone, but show more \\ndiversity in the branching and the presence of different monosac charides [ 20,21,23]. However, \\nexceptions do exist, for instance, fucoidans from the Bifurcaria bifucardia  and Himanthalia elongate  do \\nnot follow or ascribe to such a structur al feature  [24].

In other studies, fucoidan was coated on CuS nanoparticles \\nand applied in chemophotothermal therapy against cancer  cells49. In this case, fucoidan was introduced onto \\nthe CuS surface by a layer-by-layer technique using polycationic and anionic compounds. In another study, Shin \\net\\xa0al.50 developed fucoidan-coated manganese dioxide nanoparticles (Fuco-MnO2-NPs) and tested them in the \\nclinical treatment of cancer.

This can be done by spreading the algae thinly on surfaces or using specialized drying equipment.\n\nAnother method is using filtration or decantation processes, where the macroalgae slurry is passed through a filter or allowed to settle, separating the water from the biomass.\n\nOverall, the best method for dewatering macroalgae depends on the specific characteristics of the algae, the desired moisture content, and the available resources and infrastructure. Experimenting with different methods and optimizing the dewatering process for your specific requirements is key to achieving efficient and effective results.",

The process of harvesting and dewatering microalgae \\nnecessitates a signiﬁcant amount of time and energy, which raises the production \\ncosts and environmental impact of microalgae-based products (Musa et al. 2019 ). \\nFurthermore, the methods employed to harvest and dewater microalgae may impact \\nthe quality and viability of the microalgae biomass, reducing its worth and applica-\\nbility for various applications (Musa et al. 2020 ; Vrasna et al. 2022 ). So, more \\nresearch needs to be conducted to develop effective and sustainable microalgae \\nharvesting and dewatering techniques that are both cost-effective and environmen-\\ntally friendly. On the other hand, seaweed has a lower surface-to-volume ratio, which makes dewatering relatively easier. Seaweed can be air-dried or sun-dried, \\nwhich is a simpler and less energy-intensive process compared to microalgae dewatering. Algae for Aquaculture: Recent Technological Applications 539\\n3.3 Combined Algae Diets \\nOne of the challenges of using microalgae in aquaculture is to preserve their \\nnutritional quality after dewatering and drying processes, which can cause degrada-tion of essential fatty acids and other compounds. Another challenge is to match the nutritional composition of microalgae with the speciﬁc requirements of different aquatic species, which may vary in their preferences and needs. Therefore, combin-\\ning algae diet may be a promising strategy to overcome these challenges and \\nenhance the performance and health of aquaculture organisms. In this context, Sarker et al. (\\n2020 ) conducted an experiment that used two types of microalgae, \\nNannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium sp., to replace ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil in \\ntilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) feed. The results showed that the microalgae-based \\nfeed improved the growth, weight gain, protein digestibility, and DHA content of tilapia compared to a conventional feed. \\nThe s tudy i nvestigated the use of seaweeds Gracilaria gracilis and microalga \\nNannochloropsis oceanica, either alone or blended, in the diet of European seabass \\n(Dicentrarchus labrax). The ﬁsh were fed with four different diets for 106 days, \\nincluding a control diet, a diet with 8% G. gracilis, a diet with 8% N. oceanica, and a \\nblend of 4% of each algae. The results showed that all ﬁsh had similar growth and \\nfeed intake (Batista et al. 2020 ), while the inclusion of N. oceanica did not affect \\nnutrient utilization. The use of G. gracilis resulted in higher nitrogen and energy \\nretention efﬁciency. \\nWhite sea urchin (T. gratilla) juveniles were raised for 3 weeks and fed with \\ndifferent seaweed species including Ulva pertusa, Undaria pinnatiﬁda, and \\nGloiopeltis furcata and a mixture of them (1:1:1). The study revealed that speciﬁc \\ngrowth rates, feed conversion efﬁciencies, and fatty acid proﬁles varied among the \\ndifferent diets, which could be attributed to the varying FAs proﬁles of the seaweeds \\nused (Floreto et al. 1996 ).

Apart from this, the complete biomass\\nrecovery and simultaneous removal of other contaminants like protozoa, bacteria,viruses, and other micro-organisms (Judd 2008 ) give this technology an edge over\\nothers. Furthermore, because of no chemical or coagulant usage, the resultantmedia/water after ﬁltration can be recycled for other purposes like irrigation(Zhang et al. 2010 ).\\nMembrane ﬁltration uses several types of permeable membranes, which is the\\nonly investment cost in this harvesting technique. The application of the membrane\\nand manufacturing material determines the cost of the membrane. Before and\\nduring microalgal harvesting, there are few parameters, which need to be optimizedfor maximum biomass recovery, for example, membrane preparation, porosity,thickness, permeability, and ﬂux (Bilad et al. 2012 ).\\nT h er e c e n ts t u d i e sa r ef o c u s s e do na s s e s s i n gt h et y p eo fm i c r o ﬁ l t e r s( M F ,\\n0.2–0.8 μM) or ultraﬁlters (UF, different MWCO ~10–100 kDa) best suitable for\\nharvesting and ﬂux maintenance. The materials commonly used for microﬁltrationmembranes are polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF), a combination of PVDF and N,N-\\nDimethylformamide (DMF), mixed cellulose ester (MCE), etc. For ultraﬁlter, gen-\\nerally Polyether sulfone (PES) and Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) are being used (Rickmanet al. 2012 ; Sun et al. 2013 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ). The concentration and combinations\\nof these materials govern the pore size of membrane. Flux rate, deﬁned as ﬂow perunit area, is the most important parameter to judge the efﬁcacy of the technique. Theresults of the critical parameters like ﬂux determination by ﬂux stepping test indicatedthat the fouling of member due to lower ﬂux rate is more prone in ultraﬁlters. Acomparative study on use of MF, UF, and a modiﬁed UF made up of ﬂuoropolymers\\n(PVDF) has been recently done (Sun et al. 2013 ). The results indicated that there was\\nsigniﬁcant increase in permeate ﬂux in the initial phase of experiment by MF ascompared to UF, which steeply declined within 3 h similar to UF. The fast foulingtendency of MF due to bigger pore size was the reason given to this phenomenon. Onthe other hand, a modiﬁed UF made up of composite PVDF was the only membranewhich was hydrophilic in nature and it showed the highest permeate ﬂux. Therefore,apart from the membrane material, hydrophilic nature of the membrane is also one ofthe most important criteria for complete algal harvesting.\\n3.1.2 Centrifugation\\nCentrifugation is the most commonly used technique for dewatering algae. To\\navoid the prolonged process of common gravity sedimentation, sufﬁcient energyinput to increase the gravitation force as well as the centrifugal force leads to thequick settling of algal biomass. This technique is advantageous due to elevatedharvesting efﬁciencies within considerably less time (Molina Grima et al. 2003 ).230 M.

For example, harvesting and \\ndewatering of seaweeds require far less energy, less expensive equipment, and \\nchemicals compared to that of microalgae, thus reducing the overall cost of algal \\nbiomass production, and increasing the economic feasibility of the process.44 B. B. Uzoejinwa and F. U. Asoiro\\nSeveral methods, such as physical/mechanical (ﬁltration, sedimentation, centri-\\nfugation, ultrasound, and ﬂotation), electrical, chemical (ﬂocculation/coagulation), \\nand biological methods, as well as a possible combination of any of these techniques, \\nhave been applied for algal biomass harvesting and concentrating (Ananthi et al. \\n2021 ), with the mechanical method being the most reliable and commonly used \\nmethod (Ananthi et al. 2021 ). In order to improve the microalgae harvesting \\nefﬁciency and reduce cost, ﬂocculation and coagulation are often carried out before \\nﬁltration and centrifugation (Das et al. 2016 ; Gorin et al. 2015 ). Seaweed harvesting \\ndemands simple but laborious work, whereas microalgae harvesting involves the use \\nof elaborate chemicals and costly mechanical procedures. Results from several studies in the literature revealed that harvesting is the most challenging activity in the downstream processing of algal biomass for biofuel production, owing to the \\nassociated high cost or high power/energy input (Caetano et al. \\n2020 ; Milledge and \\nHeaven 2013 ). Amer et al. ( 2011 ) elucidated that the cost of dewatering and \\nharvesting equipment may account for over 90% of the total cost of producing \\nmicroalgal biomass from raceway/open pond cultivation systems. Thus, the efﬁcient \\nharvesting of algal biomass for commercial utilization depends largely on the type \\nand effectiveness of harvesting technique employed, the type of algae to be processed, cell density and size, the allowable degree of moisture, salt concentra-\\ntions, and cell damage (Ananthi et al. \\n2021 ; Barros et al. 2015 ). The need for \\nadditional processing of the algal biomass must also be considered while choosing \\nan effective harvesting method. Therefore, appropriate harvesting methods must not \\nbe harmful to the algal biomass or health. \\nThe c hosen h arvesting technique should also permit the reuse of the culture \\nmedia. For the majority of applications, the two-step concentration approach of thickening and dewatering is used for microalgal harvesting. To increase the solid \\nconcentration of the suspended microalgae and decrease the quantity or volume that \\nneeds to be handled, thickening is done. It consists of gravity sedimentation, ﬂotation, coagulation/ﬂocculation (both chemically and biologically based), or elec-\\ntrical techniques, such as electroporation, ultrasounds, pulsed electric ﬁelds (Guldhe \\net al. \\n2016 ), and low or moderate electric ﬁelds (Lucakova et al. 2021 ). Dewatering \\nincreases the concentration of microalgal slurry to 15–25% of total suspended solids, \\nwhich consists of various types of centrifugations and ﬁltrations (Show et al. 2015 ; \\nSingh and Patidar 2018 ). Likewise, harvesting is the major obstacle to the economic \\nproduction of seaweeds on a large scale for biofuels and/or phycochemicals. \\nCurrently, seaweed harvesting can be achieved manually or mechanically, \\ndepending on the type of species, location, biomass density, and scale of cultivation \\n(Alam et al. 2021 ; Fernand et al. 2017 ; Stagnol et al. 2013 ). Harvesting of seaweeds \\nmakes up 20–30% of the total costs of biomass production and further downstream \\nprocessing (Fernand et al. 2017 ; Mac Monagail et al. 2017 ).

Macroalgae are\\ndifferent in several aspects, such as morphology, life span and physiology.\\nAccording to their pigmentation, they are divided into Phaeophyta (brown),\\nRhodophyta (red) and Chlorophyta (green) algae (Chan et al. 2006 ). The growth\\nof macroalgae on rocky substrates results in a stable multi-layered perennial vege-\\ntation that is capable of capturing nearly all of the available photons in the natural\\nenvironment. Almost 200 species of macroalgae are utilized all over the world, in\\nwhich about ten are more commonly cultivated like Laminaria japonica,\\nPhaeophyta ,Rhodophyta ,Undaria pinnati ﬁda,Gracilaria ,Eucheuma ,Porphyra ,\\nKappaphycus Monostroma ,Kappaphycus and Chlorophyta Enteromorpha (Lüning\\nand Pang 2003 ).\\nSome macroalgae species collect a large number of carbohydrates that can be\\nused as a substrate in microbial conversion activities, such as the manufacture ofbiofuels with a high product cost (Kraan 2013 ). Table 2.2indicates different algal\\nstrains that can produce different fuels. Maceiras et al. ( 2011 ) recently discovered\\nthat a transesteri ﬁcation process could be used to produce biodiesel from triglycer-\\nides by using a variety of macroalgae, including Codium tomentosum ,Ascophyllum\\nnodosum ,Fucus spiralis ,Enteromorpha intestinalis ,Sargassum muticum ,Pelvetia\\ncanaliculata ,Saccorhiza polyschides and Ulva rigida. It has been observed that\\nmacroalgae have a higher water content (80 –85%) than terrestrial plants, making\\nthem better suitable for the thermochemical conversion of microbial conversion than\\nthe direct combustion process. Macroalgae like Gracilaria spp.,Sargassum spp.,\\nLaminaria spp., Prymnesium parvum andGelidium amansii are best targets for\\nproduction of bioethanol (Adams et al. 2009 ; Wi et al. 2009 ).\\nTable 2.2 Different algal strains from the production of biofuels\\nStrain of algae Type of biofuel Reference\\nLaminaria sp.

        "user_question_enriched": "Not enriched",
        "LLM_answer": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Baltic Sea are primarily caused by nutrient pollution, particularly from agricultural runoff, sewage discharges, and atmospheric deposition. The excessive nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, fuel the growth of algae which can lead to the formation of HABs. Climate change, warming water temperatures, and changes in salinity levels can also contribute to the occurrence of HABs in the Baltic Sea.\n\nTo mitigate harmful algal blooms in the Baltic Sea, there are several strategies that can be implemented:\n\n1. Implement measures to reduce nutrient inputs: Improved agricultural practices, such as precision farming and reduced fertilizer usage, can help minimize nutrient runoff into water bodies. Upgrading and controlling sewage treatment plants can also help reduce nutrient discharges into the Baltic Sea.\n\n2. Enhance monitoring and early warning systems: Regular monitoring of water quality, algae populations, and nutrient levels can help detect and predict the occurrence of HABs. Developing early warning systems can help authorities and stakeholders take timely action to mitigate the impacts of HABs.\n\n3. Promote sustainable land use practices: Encouraging sustainable land use practices, such as land conservation, buffer strip cultivation, and wetland restoration, can help reduce nutrient runoff and improve water quality in the Baltic Sea.\n\n4. International cooperation and policy measures: Collaboration among countries bordering the Baltic Sea is essential to address the transboundary nature of HABs. Implementation of effective policies and regulations to reduce nutrient pollution and promote sustainable use of natural resources can help mitigate the impacts of HABs in the region.\n\n5. Research and innovation: Continued research on HABs dynamics, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem interactions can provide valuable insights for developing effective mitigation strategies. Innovation in technology, such as remote sensing and modeling tools, can also help improve monitoring and management of HABs in the Baltic Sea. \n\nBy implementing a combination of these strategies and engaging stakeholders at local, national, and international levels, the harmful effects of algal blooms in the Baltic Sea can be mitigated.",

        "LLM_answer": "The carbon footprint of aquaculture of Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) can vary depending on several factors such as the cultivation method, location, energy sources used, transportation, and overall production practices. Generally, seaweed aquaculture is considered to have a low carbon footprint compared to land-based agriculture or animal farming. This is because seaweeds like Saccharina latissima absorb and sequester carbon dioxide during their growth, helping to offset carbon emissions.\n\nResearch studies have shown that seaweed aquaculture can be a sustainable and environmentally friendly practice, with the potential to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is important to consider the specific practices and inputs involved in the cultivation of Saccharina latissima to accurately estimate its carbon footprint.\n\nIf you are looking for specific data on the carbon footprint of aquaculture of Saccharina latissima, I recommend reviewing scientific literature or contacting research institutions that specialize in seaweed cultivation and sustainability assessments.",

The snow and ice algae include the  Chlamydomonas nivalis  ,  Chloromonas  , \\nthe desmid  Mesotaenium  ,  Chlorosarcina   and  Chlorella   (Hoham and Ling  2000  ; \\nLeya  2013  ). Cold-loving cyanobacteria are species of:  Chroococcidiopsis  , \\n Oscillatoria  ,  Lyngbya  ,  Microcoleus  ,  Nostoc   and  Phormidium  . \\n Psychrophilic algae grow in polar regions such as in the high Arctic, Antarctica, \\nand alpine regions. They appear in various colors in melting snow (Hoham and Ling \\n 2000  : Leya  2013  ). Spores of the green alga  Chlamydomonas nivales   appear in the \\nmelted snow as bright red, pink, or yellow – green. The snow algae contain astaxan-\\nthin as well as other algae with fatty acids. Some spores of snow algae exposed to \\nUV produce ﬂ  avonoids as antioxidant compounds which serves as a sunscreen in \\nmicroalgae such as dinoﬂ  agellates, diatoms, chlorophytes, and rhodophytes. \\nMicroalgae are abundant in the cold seas of the Arctic and Antarctica. Several spe-\\ncies of diatoms adapt to cold temperatures as in permafrost and in glaciers.  \\n2.3     Algal Life in Extreme Ranges of pH \\n2.3.1     The Acidophilic Algae \\n Among the low pH areas are environments, such as the acido-thermo hot springs of \\nYellowstone National Park (USA), Iceland hot springs, in Pozzuoli area (near \\nNaples, IT), the non-thermal Tinto River (Spain), and in old abundant mines, which \\nsupport various algae. Some acidophilic areas may reach a pH range around 3 to \\nO. In general, DNA and ATP are unstable in acid solutions and in most acidophiles \\nthe internal pH is close to neutral pH while the external media is acidic (see table of \\nexternal – internal pH level, in Seckbach  2000  , page 112). Among the acidophilic \\nalgae are:  Chlamydomonas acidophila  ,  Chlorella spp  ..,  Chara coralline  , \\n Scenedesmus quadricauda  ,  Dunaliella acidophila  ,  Eremosphaera viridis  ,  Euglena \\nmutabilis  ,  Cyanidium caldarium   with its two cohorts, and the diatoms (e.g., \\nP innularia  ) (Seckbach  2000  ). \\n There is a mechanism in the acidophiles that prevents H+ ions from entering the \\ncells. In general, photosynthetic prokaryotes do not grow in acidic media. However \\nat pH 2, the cyanobacteria  Oscillatorial  / Limnothrix   and  Spirulina   spp. were found \\nin acid Bavarian lakes (Steinberg et al.  1998  ).

The H+ pump is one of \\nthe balancing methods against the high acidity in nature. In addition,  Dunaliella \\nacidophila   and  Chlamydomonas acidophila   are known to grow at pH 1–2 in many \\nnon-thermal acid waters, as are  Euglena mutabilis   (pH 1–5) and the acidophilic \\ndiatoms (pH 0–4) are.

A variety of conven-\\ntional and modern techniques are available for isolation, characterization and iden-\\ntiﬁ cation of different species of algae. An alga is generally characterized on the \\nbasis of its size, colour, shape, form or growth habit. Some algae are visible to the \\nnaked eye whereas others can be seen with the help of a magnifying glass or a \\nmicroscope. Algae are divided into two groups based on size: macroalgae and \\nmicroalgae. Algae growing in the form of large, plant-like structures are called \\n‘macroalgae’ (e.g. Seaweeds and kelps). ‘Microalgae’ is a very broad term for all \\nmicroscopic, photosynthetic protists. Microalgae that swim or drift within the well- \\nlit regions of the water bodies are collectively termed “phytoplankton”. Microalgae \\nthat inhabit the surfaces such as sea ﬂ  oor or river bottoms are called “benthic micro-\\nalgae”. The common unit for measuring microalgae is micrometer ( μm). \\nPhytoplankton can be differentiated on the basis of cell size into micro- phytoplankton \\n(200–20 μm), nano-phytoplankton (20–2 μm) and pico-phytoplankton (2–0.2 μm). \\nWhile the microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton are easily identiﬁ  ed with \\nconventional techniques for instance light microscopy, the picophytoplankton can \\nonly be distinguished by ﬂ  uorescence techniques.\\n   Microscopes are essential tools for studying algae.

This\\nlack of appreciation of the world ’s most important plants is not surprising, at least\\namong English-speaking populations. Consider the common names used for the\\nalgae: pond scum, seaweeds, and even frog spittle! Indeed many people only\\nexperience algae in “bad situations ”such as a big problem in local lakes, fishing\\nholes, or even personal swimming pools, or as insect-covered seaweed litter on thebeach or as contaminants in tropical fish tanks, or even worse, as red tidespoisoning our seafood and/or us. Perhaps there is no wonder about why more peoplehave never, ever taken a phycology course to understand the plants upon which theirlives totally depend. This article will, one hopes, serve as a mini-phycology course\\nthat will provide just enough background information to give the reader who hasvery little awareness about algae a basic appreciation of what they are and howtremendous the variation in size, habitat, and “life style ”among algae is. Thus,\\nwhen one encounters the mounting mass of articles about algae and biofuels or algae\\nand carbon capture, etc., there will a co ntext for understanding which algae are\\nbeing proposed to do what functions.\\nNow no one likes to begin an overview article on an important topic with a\\ncontroversy and I will avoid controversy by explaining I have placed the word“plants ”in the title in quotes to avoid or at least minimize controversy. Some people\\nwould argue (strongly) that “plants ”are only the land plants we all commonly think\\nof as plants (the bryophytes —mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, pteridophytes —\\nferns and fern allies, gymnosperms —conifers and their kin, and angiosperms —the\\nflowering plants). Others would say molecu lar evidence shows clearly that the green\\nalgae (i.e., the Chlorophyta) and the land plants are plants, but no other algae are.Others, also citing molecular evidence, would say that the red algae (i.e., the\\nRhodophyta) are also “plants. ”But to extend the term “plants ”any further, beyond\\nthe land plants, green algae, and red algae, may be very troubling (horrifying) tosome. The vexation caused might reach its peak over calling the blue –green algae\\nplants —in fact there is even controversy about calling them blue –green algae rather\\nthan cyanobacteria (despite the fact that the former term is more colorful). Well,often controversies rage simply because people accept different definitions of terms(and actually have no real basis for quarrel at all beyond the definitions). Thus, toavoid even a hint of controvers y, the working definition of “plants ”for this article is\\nas follows: organisms that contain chlorophyll aand perform oxyg en-producing\\nphotosynthesis (and their col orless close relatives [e.g., Astasia is thought of as a\\ncolorless Euglena that no longer has chloroplasts]). With this definition the blue –green\\nalgae can remain truly cyanobacteria but we can call them plants. And we do not have to\\nsay that the magnificent, giant, plant-like kel ps are not plants. Clearly, those who cannot\\nabide this working definition of “plants ”can simply use whatever definition they prefer\\nin their own writings, and forgive me for using “plants ”as a convenient term for this\\narticle.\\nPlan of attack This article will begin with a simple grammar lesson, comment on\\nattitudes, discussion of some the major ex amples of the importance of algae, and a\\nvery brief introduction to some major groups of algae. It will then return to additional\\nways in which the algae are far more important to humankind than most humans\\nrealize.6 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2013) 18:5 –12', metadata={'authors': 'Russell Leonard Chapman  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/s11027-010-9255-9.pdf', 'page': 1.0, 'publication_date': '2013', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/s11027-010-9255-9.pdf', 'title': 'Algae: the world’s most important “plants”—an introduction  '})], 'question': 'how can I start learning about algae\\r\\n'}\r\n\r\n        Question: how can I start learning about algae",

        "user_question_enriched": "Not enriched",
        "LLM_answer": "Extracting fucoidans from Saccharina latissima can be done through a series of steps. Fucoidans are sulfated polysaccharides that are found in brown algae, including Saccharina latissima. Here is a general overview of the extraction process:\n\n1. Harvesting: The first step is to collect fresh Saccharina latissima from its natural habitat, such as the ocean. The algae should be cleaned thoroughly to remove any debris or contaminants.\n\n2. Washing: The algae should be washed with clean water to remove any external impurities.\n\n3. Drying: The washed algae can be dried using methods such as air drying or freeze drying. This step helps to preserve the algae and facilitate subsequent extraction processes.\n\n4. Grinding: The dried algae can be ground into a fine powder using a grinder or mill. This increases the surface area of the algae, making it easier to extract fucoidans.\n\n5. Extraction: There are several methods for extracting fucoidans from Saccharina latissima, including hot water extraction, acid extraction, and enzyme-assisted extraction. Hot water extraction is a common method where the ground algae is mixed with hot water and stirred for a certain period of time. The fucoidans are then extracted into the water.\n\n6. Filtration: The extract is filtered to remove any solid particles or debris, leaving a clear fucoidan-containing solution.\n\n7. Concentration: The fucoidan extract can be concentrated through methods such as evaporation or freeze drying to increase the concentration of fucoidans in the extract.\n\n8. Purification: Depending on the intended use of the fucoidans, further purification steps may be needed to remove any impurities or contaminants from the extract.\n\n9. Analysis: Finally, the fucoidan extract can be analyzed for its chemical composition, structure, and potential biological activities.\n\nIt's important to note that the extraction process can be optimized based on the specific properties of the fucoidans desired and the intended application of the extract. Multiple techniques and parameters can be adjusted to yield the highest quality and quantity of fucoidans from Saccharina latissima.",

S.\\nﬁlipendula was collected in October 2017 (for crude extract) and in January 2018 (for molecular weight\\nfractions) in Santa Marta, Colombia (Otros ínumber 5, Framework Contract for Access to Genetic\\nResources and their Derived Products N◦126 of 2016, register number RGE0156-5). The collected\\nmaterial was washed and dried at 50◦C in an oven for 6 h. The dried seaweed (DS) was coarsely\\npowdered in a co ﬀee grinder. The isolation of the fucoidan was carried out according to the methodology\\nproposed by Synytsya et al. [ 87] with minor modiﬁcations. Sixty grams of the DS was added to 960 mL\\nof HCl 0.1M and allowed to stand at 4◦C for 24 h. The resulting ﬁltrate was neutralized with 1 M NaOH\\nand precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. Then, the crude extract was obtained after centrifugation\\nfor 30 min at 4500 RPM. The resulting precipitate was re-dissolved in water and the pH was adjusted to\\n2 with 1 M HCl.

This result\\nindicated that the classical solvent extraction method was more efﬁcient for fucoidan\\nextraction from F. vesiculosus . However, the classical method was performed for longer\\ntime for 3 h, twice extraction, and use of 1:10 biomass to solvent ratio.\\n2.2. Chemical Characterization\\n2.2.1. Fucoidans-Related Contents\\nDiverse characters of the extracted fucoidans were investigated to assess the applied\\nextraction technique, extracted products, and to give a nearly complete chemical picture\\nbefore the following bioactivity assays. The results are summarized in Table 2 regard-\\ning sugar content, fucoidan content, sulfation degree, total phenolic content (TPC), and\\nprotein contents.\\nThe results in Table 2 showed that fucoidan isolated from L. saccharina was relatively\\ndifferent from other fucoidans with respect to all investigated parameters. It showed the\\nhighest sugar content with 0.47 mg glucose equivalent/mg extract compared with 0.12\\nand 0.13 mg glucose equivalent/mg extract for F. spiralis and F. vesiculosus , respectively,\\nextracted by the same conditions, whereas F. vesiculosus extracted by classical solvent\\nextraction also showed lower sugar content [47].\\nAdditionally, determination of fucoidan content by toluidine blue assay used F. vesicu-\\nlosus and Undaria pinnatiﬁda as reference standards since there is no reference fucoidan\\nderived from L. saccharina orF. spiralis commercially. The results showed that L. saccha-\\nrina contained low fucoidan content with only 0.09 and 0.11 mg/mg extract equivalent\\nto fucoidan derived from F. vesiculosus and U. pinnatiﬁda , respectively. However, the\\nother fucoidans type showed comparable content. Nevertheless, the classical extraction\\nshowed higher content compared with MAE for F. vesiculosus fucoidan. Such ﬁndings\\nwere conﬁrmed by the elemental analysis and calculations of sulfation degree, where L.\\nsaccharina showed a degree of sulfation of 0.13, while the other Fucus sp. showed nearly\\nsimilar sulfation degree around 0.74 near to that extracted by solvent extraction. These\\nresults are in agreement with previous reports, which showed that L. saccharina contained a\\nmannoglucuronofucans fraction, which is partially sulfated, i.e., fraction L.s.-1.0 [49].\\nMoreover, Mw measurement revealed similar values of MAE fucoidans at 16.53, 15.87,\\nand 16.42 kDa for F. vesiculosus _MAE, F. spiralis _MAE, and L. saccharina _MAE, which are\\nconsidered lower than reported previously for F. vesiculosus by classical solvent extraction\\nat 64 kDa [ 42]. The decrease obtained Mw of MAE fucoidans indicated a high possibility\\nof polymer hydrolysis in comparison with that extracted by classical solvent extraction.\\nMoreover, MAE is considered a more drastic extraction method compared with EAE, which\\nwas used with L. saccharina and resulted in fucoidan with Mw of 50–100 kDa [50].\\nFurthermore, the chromatograms of monosaccharide composition analysis shown\\nin Figure S1 (Supplementary Material) resulted in identiﬁcation of galactose and glucose\\nin all fucoidans, in addition to glucose which was not found in F. vesiculosus _MAE. The\\nratios between glucose:galactose:fucose were 0.0:0.03:1.0, 0.03:0.03:1.0, 0.92:0.09:1.0, and\\n0.02:0.03:1.0 in F. vesiculosus _MAE, F. spiralis _MAE, and L. saccharina _MAE, and F. vesiculo-\\nsus_solvent extraction (SE), respectively. The high ratio of glucose in L. saccharina _MAE\\nconﬁrmed the high sugar content shown in Table 2.

[9]. Interestingly, the extrac ted product was referred to as a “polyfucose ethereal \\nsulphate occurring in the Phaeophyceae ”. Their optimal fucoidan extraction procedure was as follows: \\nOne part by weight of dried gr ound seaweed and 10 parts by volume of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid at \\npH 2.0–2.5 contacted at 70 °C with constant stir ring for 1 h. A single acid hydrolysis extraction \\ntreatment using this method recovered about 50% by weight (w/w) of the theoretical maximum of \\nfucoidan (recovered yield measured as % fucose obt ained as % of total fucose in the seaweed dry \\nweight), whereas three rounds of the acid extraction recovered more than 80% of the fucose present; \\nthe triple acid hydrolysis tr eatment (0.1 M HCl, pH 2.0–2.5, 70 °C, 1 h × 3) was therefore selected as \\nthe optimal extraction method (Table 1). After the ac id hydrolysis treatment the crude fucoidan was \\nisolated by fractional precipitation with alcohol a nd further purified by precip itation after addition of \\nformaldehyde [9]. By this procedure samples of  crude fucoidan containing 30–36% fucose were \\nobtained; for example, the fucoidan recovered from F. vesiculosus  using the optimal extraction \\nprotocol was analyzed to contai n (by weight) 44% fucose; 26% tota l sulfate, and 31% ash [9].  \\nIn terms of yields, calculated as fucose as % of to tal fucose, the results obtained for the four different \\nalgal species were: Pelvetia canaliculata  76%; F. vesiculosus  62%; Ascophyllum nodusum  54%, and  \\nL. cloustoni  20% [9]. The authors suggested that a more efficient extraction methodology,   \\ni.e., extracting higher fucose yields, could be ach ieved by increasing the water/seaweed ratio, \\nextraction time or number of extractions. \\nIn a study about 20 years later, FCSPs from the brown seaweeds Himanthalia lorea , Bifurcaria \\nbifurcata  and Padina pavonia  were extracted successively using di lute acid, followed by alkaline or \\nneat water extraction, acid, and alkali in sequence [12] (Table 2) . Prior to extraction, the seaweed \\nfronds were treated with formaldehyde to polymerize phenolic constituents which might otherwise contaminate the extracted saccharides [12]. This extraction protocol produced a complex mixture of \\nglucans, fucose-containing polysaccharides, and algi nic acid which could be separated by fractional \\nprecipitation with ethano l, calcium salts (CaCl\\n2) or by fractionation on re sin columns. The FCSPs \\nextracted in this fashion were reported to be he teropolysaccharides containing different levels of \\nfucose, glucuronic acid, xylose, and esterified sulf ate, together with traces of galactose [12]. The \\nresults also showed that the sulfate and uronic acid  contents in the FCSPs separated from the aqueous \\ncalcium chloride and acid extracts varied signi ficantly according to the seaweed species [12]. \\nAnother study was conducted on the purification of  a sulfated heteropolysaccharide substance from \\nSargassum linifolium  to elucidate its structural compone nts [13]. The extraction was done using \\nhydrochloric acid at pH 1.0 for 3 h at 80 °C (Table 2); the extract was then neutralized with aqueous \\nsodium carbonate and precipitated w ith ethanol [13]. The resulting sulfated polysaccharide material, \\ntermed “sargassan”, was proposed to be built of gl ucuronic acid, mannose, and galactose residues with \\npartially sulfated side-chains composed of galact ose, xylose and fucose residues [13]. As discussed \\nlater, we now know that Sargassum  spp. do indeed contain highly complex FCSPs structures built \\nfrom this array of monosaccharides.', metadata={'authors': 'Marcel Tutor Ale, Jørn D.

        "LLM_answer": "In the EU, health claims on food products, including algae-based supplements, are regulated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission. The process of applying for a health claim approval for algae-based food supplements in the EU involves several steps:\n\n1. **Scientific Substantiation**: The first step is to gather scientific evidence supporting the health claim you wish to make for your algae-based supplement. This evidence should be based on human intervention studies, observational studies, or mechanistic studies demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship between the consumption of the algae supplement and the claimed health benefit.\n\n2. **Health Claim Proposal**: Prepare a detailed health claim proposal that includes the specific wording of the claim, the target population, the conditions of use, and the proposed mechanism by which the algae-based supplement exerts its claimed health effect.\n\n3. **Submission to EFSA**: Submit the health claim proposal to EFSA for evaluation. EFSA will assess the scientific validity of the evidence provided and determine if the claim is substantiated. It is recommended to consult EFSA guidance documents on the submission of health claims to ensure that all necessary requirements are met.\n\n4. **EFSA Evaluation**: EFSA will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the scientific data and issue an opinion on the health claim proposal within a specified time frame. The opinion may be positive, negative, or inconclusive based on the strength of evidence presented.\n\n5. **European Commission Approval**: If EFSA issues a positive opinion on the health claim proposal, the European Commission will consider granting approval for the health claim to be used on the packaging and marketing of the algae-based supplement. Approval is granted through a formal regulatory process, and the wording of the health claim may be subject to modification based on EFSA's opinion.\n\nIt is important to note that the process of obtaining health claim approval for algae-based food supplements in the EU can be complex and time-consuming. Therefore, it is advisable to seek guidance from regulatory experts or consultants with experience in this area to ensure a successful application. Additionally, staying informed about the latest regulations and guidelines related to health claims in the EU can help streamline the application process.",

The underlying\\nproblems and obstacles associated with the clinical use of fucoidan(s) is discussed in this\\nreview, with particular focus on the immunopotentiating activity of fucoidans and their\\nrelevance to cancer immunotherapy.\\nFucoidans were ﬁrst isolated from the extracellular mucus matrix of brown macroalgae,\\nclass Phaeophycceae, species Fucus vesiculosus ,Asophyllum nodosum ,Laminaria digiata ,\\nand Laminaria saccharina , in 1913, by the Swedish professor Hareld Kylin at Uppsala\\nUniversity [ 11–13]. The name fucoidan was initially used as a general term referring to a\\nvariety of high-molecular weight sulfated polysaccharides derived from ﬁbrillar cell walls\\nand mucous matrices of diverse species of brown macroalgae [ 14]. Until relatively recently,\\nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) based the fucoidan\\nnomenclature on the generic sulfated fucan structure—a polysaccharide with a backbone\\nstructure based on sulfated L-fucose residues, with the main structure consisting of a\\nminimum of 10 monosaccharides [ 15]. Hence, the names fucoidan, fucoidans, and sulfated\\nfucans have been used synonymously in the literature, distinct from fucans and fucosans.\\nRecently, in 2017, the term fucoidan(s) from brown algae was revised, and now is clearly\\nestablished to refer to heteropolymers with more diverse backbones [14].\\nThe bioactivities of these versatile marine-origin heteropolysaccharides differ depend-\\ning on the seaweed species and environmental growth conditions. There are approximately\\n250 genera and 1500–2000 species of brown algae, and chemical composition, structure\\nof fucoidans, and bioactivity differ from species to species [ 16]. Fucoidan extracts from\\nvarious species of brown seaweed consist of different amounts of monosaccharide com-\\npositions, including fucose, mannose, galactose, glucose, and xylose [ 17]. The proportion\\nof these monosaccharides within each fucoidan inﬂuences its capability to induce a par-\\nticular pharmacological activity. For example, Fucus vesiculosus fucoidan shows a strong\\n1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity [ 17] and Ascophyllum\\nnodosum fucoidan promotes T cell proliferation [ 18]. Hence, it is important to be aware\\nthat the source of a fucoidan plays a critical role in inducing its pharmacological activities,\\nand, therefore, throughout this review we have identiﬁed the source, molecular weight of\\nthe fucoidan, and subsequent fraction isolates when it has been speciﬁed in the literature.\\nMethods of extraction are also major factors affecting the structural composition and bioac-\\ntive properties of fucoidans both within and between brown algae species (discussed in\\nSection 2).\\nAll these factors mentioned contribute to the difﬁculty in determining the type of\\nfucoidan and the effective dose of a speciﬁc fucoidan for use in preclinical and clinical\\nstudies. Fucoidan derivatives or variants, where the molecular weight of fucoidan has\\nbeen substantially reduced to as little as two or three monosaccharides, have been shown\\nto lack the immune ability (activation) of a high molecular weight fucoidan (HMWF) [ 19].\\nHighly puriﬁed fucoidan fractions, deﬁned as low molecular weight fucoidans (LMWFs),\\nalso fall below the standard IUPAC deﬁnition of a fucoidan with reduced or altered bioac-\\ntivity. Hence, the molecular weight and bioactivity of fucoidans and their variants used in\\npreclinical studies inﬂuence efﬁcacy and are important discussion points in this review.\\nCancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and adoptive T\\ncell transfer therapy (such as CAR-T cell therapy), has revolutionized cancer treatment and\\nachieved an unprecedented clinical outcome in the treatment of homological malignancies.', metadata={'authors': 'Yani Li, Eileen McGowan, Size Chen, Jerran Santos, Haibin Yin, Yiguang Lin', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC9961398.pdf', 'page': 1.0, 'publication_date': '2023', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC9961398.pdf', 'title': 'Immunopotentiating Activity of Fucoidans and Relevance to Cancer Immunotherapy'})], 'question': 'How many authorized patents relate to fuc\\r\\noidan as a food supplement or an ingredient in a food supplement?'}\r\n\r\n        Question: How many authorized patents relate to fuc\r\noidan as a food supplement or an ingredient in a food supplement?",

With their holdfasts they attach onto hard rocky structures and grow upwards. They are sessile organisms that generate energy through the process of photosynthesis. They also have air vesicles inside of them to keep them upright and maintain buoyancy.  They are eaten by a variety of species who do not eat the algae itself, but eat the various fragments that drift away from Choristocarpaceae in the water. Choristocarpaceae provide a habitat for fish and other species to live within and around. Reproduction happens via the use of spores and gametes that are released into the water column and then fertilize another member of their species that will start a new Choristocarpaceae that will eventually attach onto a hard substrate. Both asexual and sexual reproduction takes place. The species has an isomorphic life history with a  a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte.\\n\\nTaxonomy\\nBecause they possessed uniseriate filamentous thalli with apical growth cells, Choristocarpaceae  were originally put in the same family as Discosporangiales. Due to factors such as their different vegetative filaments, Discosporangiales were entered into their own unique family and genus. Others have argued that Discosporangiales should be classified into the order Sphacelariales. Further DNA analysis dissuaded that theory from taking hold. It showed that Choristocarpaceae represent a separate lineage and are only distantly related to Sphacelariales. When doing a phylogenetic tree analysis it was further found that Choristocarpaceae should be placed in their own lineage separate from other brown algae. As a species, Choristocarpaceae may have evolved more recently in evolutionary history than their brown algae relatives, resulting in their taxonomic status.\\n\\n\\n== References ==', metadata={'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choristocarpaceae', 'authors': 'Wikipedia', 'publication_date': '2024', 'title': 'Choristocarpaceae'}), Document(page_content='Algae 2022, 37(4): 249-264\\nhttps://doi.org/10.4490/algae.2022.37.10.31\\n262R.

        "LLM_answer": "To remove impurities such as alginates when extracting fucoidans from algae species like Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) or Fucus vesiculosus (bladderwrack), several methods can be employed:\n\n1. **Fractionation Techniques**: Utilize fractionation techniques such as selective precipitation or chromatography to separate fucoidans from alginates based on their different physical and chemical properties. This can help isolate the desired fucoidans from the alginates.\n\n2. **Enzymatic Treatment**: Employ enzymes that specifically target alginates to break them down and separate them from fucoidans. Enzymatic treatment can be used as a pre-treatment step before extraction to facilitate the separation process.\n\n3. **Dialysis**: Dialysis can be employed to separate fucoidans from alginates based on their molecular weight differences. The fucoidans, typically having higher molecular weights than alginates, can be retained inside the dialysis membrane while smaller alginates pass through.\n\n4. **Size Exclusion Chromatography**: Size exclusion chromatography can be utilized to separate fucoidans from alginates based on their molecular size. This method relies on the differential exclusion of molecules of varying sizes, allowing for the separation of fucoidans from alginates.\n\n5. **Selective Solvent Extraction**: Using selective solvents that preferentially dissolve fucoidans over alginates can help in separating the two components. By optimizing the solvent composition and extraction conditions, fucoidans can be selectively extracted while leaving alginates behind.\n\nIt is important to optimize the extraction and purification process based on the specific properties of the algae species and the desired purity level of the extracted fucoidans. By employing a combination of these methods, it is possible to effectively remove impurities such as alginates during the extraction of fucoidans from algae.",

Ionic Liquids: Ionic liquids are considered green solvents due to their low volatility, non-flammability, and recyclability. They have been used effectively in the extraction of fucoidans from seaweeds.\n\n2. Supercritical Fluids: Solvents such as carbon dioxide in its supercritical state can be used for the extraction of fucoidans. Supercritical fluid extraction is considered environmentally friendly as it reduces solvent usage and minimizes waste generation.\n\n3. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES): DES are mixtures of two or more components that form a eutectic mixture with a lower melting point than each individual component. They have been explored as green solvents for fucoidan extraction due to their low toxicity and biodegradability.\n\n4. Ethanol/Water Mixtures: Ethanol is a common solvent used in fucoidan extraction, and when combined with water in specific ratios, it can be considered a more sustainable solvent system compared to pure organic solvents.\n\n5. Glycerol: Glycerol is a biodegradable solvent that has been investigated for fucoidan extraction. It is considered green due to its low toxicity and renewability.\n\nThese green solvents offer sustainable alternatives to conventional organic solvents, reducing environmental impact and improving the overall sustainability of fucoidan extraction processes from seaweeds.",

The underlying\\nproblems and obstacles associated with the clinical use of fucoidan(s) is discussed in this\\nreview, with particular focus on the immunopotentiating activity of fucoidans and their\\nrelevance to cancer immunotherapy.\\nFucoidans were ﬁrst isolated from the extracellular mucus matrix of brown macroalgae,\\nclass Phaeophycceae, species Fucus vesiculosus ,Asophyllum nodosum ,Laminaria digiata ,\\nand Laminaria saccharina , in 1913, by the Swedish professor Hareld Kylin at Uppsala\\nUniversity [ 11–13]. The name fucoidan was initially used as a general term referring to a\\nvariety of high-molecular weight sulfated polysaccharides derived from ﬁbrillar cell walls\\nand mucous matrices of diverse species of brown macroalgae [ 14]. Until relatively recently,\\nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) based the fucoidan\\nnomenclature on the generic sulfated fucan structure—a polysaccharide with a backbone\\nstructure based on sulfated L-fucose residues, with the main structure consisting of a\\nminimum of 10 monosaccharides [ 15]. Hence, the names fucoidan, fucoidans, and sulfated\\nfucans have been used synonymously in the literature, distinct from fucans and fucosans.\\nRecently, in 2017, the term fucoidan(s) from brown algae was revised, and now is clearly\\nestablished to refer to heteropolymers with more diverse backbones [14].\\nThe bioactivities of these versatile marine-origin heteropolysaccharides differ depend-\\ning on the seaweed species and environmental growth conditions. There are approximately\\n250 genera and 1500–2000 species of brown algae, and chemical composition, structure\\nof fucoidans, and bioactivity differ from species to species [ 16]. Fucoidan extracts from\\nvarious species of brown seaweed consist of different amounts of monosaccharide com-\\npositions, including fucose, mannose, galactose, glucose, and xylose [ 17]. The proportion\\nof these monosaccharides within each fucoidan inﬂuences its capability to induce a par-\\nticular pharmacological activity. For example, Fucus vesiculosus fucoidan shows a strong\\n1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity [ 17] and Ascophyllum\\nnodosum fucoidan promotes T cell proliferation [ 18]. Hence, it is important to be aware\\nthat the source of a fucoidan plays a critical role in inducing its pharmacological activities,\\nand, therefore, throughout this review we have identiﬁed the source, molecular weight of\\nthe fucoidan, and subsequent fraction isolates when it has been speciﬁed in the literature.\\nMethods of extraction are also major factors affecting the structural composition and bioac-\\ntive properties of fucoidans both within and between brown algae species (discussed in\\nSection 2).\\nAll these factors mentioned contribute to the difﬁculty in determining the type of\\nfucoidan and the effective dose of a speciﬁc fucoidan for use in preclinical and clinical\\nstudies. Fucoidan derivatives or variants, where the molecular weight of fucoidan has\\nbeen substantially reduced to as little as two or three monosaccharides, have been shown\\nto lack the immune ability (activation) of a high molecular weight fucoidan (HMWF) [ 19].\\nHighly puriﬁed fucoidan fractions, deﬁned as low molecular weight fucoidans (LMWFs),\\nalso fall below the standard IUPAC deﬁnition of a fucoidan with reduced or altered bioac-\\ntivity. Hence, the molecular weight and bioactivity of fucoidans and their variants used in\\npreclinical studies inﬂuence efﬁcacy and are important discussion points in this review.\\nCancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and adoptive T\\ncell transfer therapy (such as CAR-T cell therapy), has revolutionized cancer treatment and\\nachieved an unprecedented clinical outcome in the treatment of homological malignancies.', metadata={'authors': 'Yani Li, Eileen McGowan, Size Chen, Jerran Santos, Haibin Yin, Yiguang Lin', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC9961398.pdf', 'page': 1.0, 'publication_date': '2023', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC9961398.pdf', 'title': 'Immunopotentiating Activity of Fucoidans and Relevance to Cancer Immunotherapy'}), Document(page_content='Food Chemistry: X 18 (2023) 100712\\n2Fucoidans are promising targets for compounds of value in the func-\\ntional food and nutraceutical industries. In fact, fucoidans have been \\napproved to be produced as food in China in 2019. Biologically, they \\nhave been found to have many beneficial effects such as antiviral, anti- \\ninflammatory, anticancer, antithrombosis (Wang et al., 2017 ), and \\nimmunomodulatory activities with low side effects (Zha et al., 2018 ). \\nIncreasing the activity of the immune system is a significant bio-\\nlogical function of fucoidans through either improved release of pro- \\ninflammatory mediators or decreased anti-inflammatory response \\n(Bahramzadeh, Tabarsa, You, Li, & Bita, 2019 ). The multifunctionality \\nof fucoidan is highly variable, and greatly dependent upon its complex \\nmolecular structure. Therefore, it is commonly believed that the \\nmagnitude of immunomodulatory activities of fucoidans is dominated \\nby compositional characteristics such as monosaccharide composition, \\nmolecular weight, and sulfate content (Borazjani, Tabarsa, You, & \\nRezaei, 2018 ). Structurally, fucoidans are highly branched hetero -\\npolysaccharides, and these structures vary within species, season, har-\\nvest location and maturity of the plant (Fletcher, Biller, Ross, & Adams, \\n2017 ). Therefore, considering the complexity of fucoidan structures and \\ntheir multiple functional abilities, significant potential exists to explore \\nnew seaweed sources in order to acquire natural polysaccharides with \\nimproved health benefits and biological activities. \\nSargassum species are present throughout subtropical and tropical \\nareas globally and have been shown to produce many structural classes \\nof metabolites such as sulfated polysaccharides, glycerides, polyphenols, \\nand terpenoids, etc., which possess many therapeutic activities (Yende, \\nHarle, & Chaugule, 2014 ). Therefore, Sargassum species have great po-\\ntential in the neutralceutical field, and have been identified as a key \\nmedicinal food of the twenty-first century. Sargassum Zhangii fucoidan \\n(SZF) is an relatively unexplored compound; although it has been re-\\nported to have cholesterol-lowering activity (Lin, Chen, & Zhong, 2022 ), \\nlittle research has been conducted into its immunomodulatory activities. \\nMotivated by this, the objective in this study was to determine the \\nimmune cell stimulating activities of SZF, and characterize its physi -\\nochemical and structural properties through a number of approaches \\nincluding ion chromatograph, high performance gel-permeation chro-\\nmatography, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and \\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), etc. The immunoregulatory activ-\\nities of the fucoidans on RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were determined \\nby the production of nitric oxide (NO), a key component of the immu -\\nnomodulatory pathway and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the \\ninducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) \\nimmune cytokines, were also determined based on protein abundance \\nand gene expression. The results show that SZF exhibit previously un-\\nreported immune stimulating activities. These results, taken together, \\nidentify SZF as an outstanding candidate for further development in the \\nfunctional or nutraceutical food fields. \\nMaterials and methods \\nChemical suppliers \\nFucoidan Fuc1 (Undaria pinnatifida source, batch# 572001015) was \\nobtained from Qingdao bright moon seaweed group co., LTD.

Nelson and Cretcher reported that fucose is the only sugar present in the\\nunhydrolyzed seaweed Macrocystis pyrifera , in which hydrolysis results in uronic acid [ 36].\\nThe removal of soluble alginates via their conversion into insoluble calcium salts is a useful\\ntechnique in this regard. Proteolytic enzyme practices facilitate the removal of protein\\ncontamination. Multiple reports published by Jayawardena et al. in recent years have\\nsuggested a modiﬁed method to purify FCSPs, implementing methods for the removal\\nof alginate and protein contamination [ 5,13]. In acid-treated fucoidan extraction, the acid\\nconcentration, time, and temperature of extraction are vital factors inﬂuencing the sample\\nyield, sulfate, and fucose content. Higher acid concentrations lead to cell wall matrix\\npenetration and disruption of the fucoidan structure. A longer extraction time decreases\\nthe fucose and sulfate contents, resulting in low-quality fucoidan [23,37].\\nPuriﬁcation of high-quality fucoidan requires further steps assisted by column chro-\\nmatography. One such method is anion-exchange chromatography. The sulfate ester groups\\nlinked to the polymer backbone provide anionic charges even at low pH values, which\\ncan be utilized during this chromatographic technique. The resin used in this method is\\nquaternary ammonium, which forms strong coulombic interactions with the loaded sample.\\nElution is performed with the application of a NaCl gradient, where its concentration\\nincreases at the later stages of the column puriﬁcation mobile system. The elution of lower\\nsulfate-containing fractions occurs ﬁrst, whereas the high sulfate fractions elute last [ 13,38].\\nThe fractions can be further subjected to gel permeation chromatography to remove salts.\\nDialysis membranes have been reported to assist further puriﬁcation; speciﬁcally, the\\nsemipermeable membranes diffuse small impurities and contribute to de-salting [7,39].\\nJasso et al. (2011) implemented microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) with optimum\\nreaction conditions to extract sulfated polysaccharides from F. vesiculosus [40]. They sum-\\nmarized it as an effective method that requires a shorter extraction time, has reduced costs,\\nand consumes less energy. Moreover, this method generates less waste, thus proving to be\\nenvironmentally friendly. However, it is highly recommended to manage and optimize\\nthe energy input. This technique distributes a heat source owing to the friction generated\\nfrom the dipolar rotation of polar solvents and the conductive migration of dissolved\\nions [ 41,42]. This wields pressure on the cell wall, resulting in cell wall breakage and\\nthe release of intracellular components. Another approach is ultrasound-assisted extrac-\\ntion (UAE), which is based on cavitation generation via ultrasound waves. Turbulence\\nand interparticle collisions convert sound waves into mechanical energy, which disrupts\\nthe cell wall. Fernandez et al. (2016) reported the use of UAE to extract fucoidan from\\nS. muticum [43]. Fucoidan from F. evanescens was extracted using the method described by\\nHmelkov et al. (2017) [ 44]. Similar to MAE, the application of energy should be optimized\\nto avoid any possible structural alterations.\\nThe efﬁcient extraction of seaweed polysaccharides is hindered by the complexity\\nand rigidity of the cell wall. This has led to the use of carbohydrates to degrade the cell\\nwall, thus releasing polysaccharides and other bioactive components. Each carbohydrase\\nmust be implemented at its optimal pH and temperature to obtain higher yields with\\npromising bioactive properties [ 45]. Sanjeewa et al.

Extraction Techniques and Potential Impurities\\nThe nature of the chemical components, method of extraction, and interfering sub-\\nstances inﬂuence the extraction [ 31]. Most polysaccharides are extracted using water, acids,\\nand organic solvents. Solvent extraction is difﬁcult to implement owing to the complex\\nnature of polymers [ 1]. The extraction procedure is a critical point in the puriﬁcation of\\nthe target compound. The yield and structural alterations of sulfated polysaccharides are\\ngreatly inﬂuenced by the appropriate adjustment of parameters such as temperature, time,\\nand pH [ 6]. This part of the review addresses the implemented extraction procedures that\\neffectively enhance the puriﬁcation of sulfated polysaccharides.\\nThe source of extraction of the sulfated polysaccharides is marine brown algae rather\\nthan marine invertebrates. The molecular weight, sulfation percentage, point of sulfation,\\nand monosaccharide composition are vital to the bioactivity of fucoidan. Therefore, pu-\\nriﬁcation should be performed under mild conditions to avoid structural shifts [ 6]. The\\napplication of an ethanolic system helps remove co-extracting interferences, such as lipids,\\nterpenes, and phenols (Figure 2). Chlorophyll pigments are immediately removed us-\\ning this method. Some researchers perform immersion and washing using acetone or\\nhexane. Phenols are tightly bound to fucoidans or other polysaccharides during the ex-\\ntraction process. Formaldehyde treatment is a method of preventing cross-contamination\\nby polymerizing phenols, proteins, and nucleic acids, and converting them into insoluble\\nhigh-molecular-weight components [ 6,32,33]. Although it is useful in eradicating inter-\\nfering modules, it may decrease fucoidan yield by interacting with polysaccharides and\\nprecipitating them into complexes [34].\\nMar.\\xa0Drugs\\xa02022,\\xa020,\\xa0x\\xa0FOR\\xa0PEER\\xa0REVIEW \\xa0 6\\xa0of\\xa019\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0specifically, \\xa0the\\xa0semipermeable \\xa0membranes \\xa0diffuse\\xa0small\\xa0impurities \\xa0and\\xa0contribute \\xa0to\\xa0de‐\\nsalting\\xa0[7,39].\\xa0\\nJasso\\xa0et\\xa0al.\\xa0(2011)\\xa0implemented \\xa0microwave ‐assisted\\xa0extraction \\xa0(MAE)\\xa0with\\xa0optimum \\xa0\\nreaction\\xa0conditions \\xa0to\\xa0extract\\xa0sulfated\\xa0polysaccharides \\xa0from\\xa0F.\\xa0vesiculosus \\xa0[40].\\xa0They\\xa0sum‐\\nmarized\\xa0it\\xa0as\\xa0an\\xa0effective\\xa0method\\xa0that\\xa0requires\\xa0a\\xa0shorter\\xa0extraction \\xa0time,\\xa0has\\xa0reduced\\xa0costs,\\xa0\\nand\\xa0consumes \\xa0less\\xa0energy.\\xa0Moreover, \\xa0this\\xa0method\\xa0generates \\xa0less\\xa0waste,\\xa0thus\\xa0proving\\xa0to\\xa0\\nbe\\xa0environmentally \\xa0friendly. \\xa0However, \\xa0it\\xa0is\\xa0highly\\xa0recommended \\xa0to\\xa0manage\\xa0and\\xa0optimize \\xa0\\nthe\\xa0energy\\xa0input.\\xa0This\\xa0technique \\xa0distributes \\xa0a\\xa0heat\\xa0source\\xa0owing\\xa0to\\xa0the\\xa0friction\\xa0generated \\xa0\\nfrom\\xa0the\\xa0dipolar\\xa0rotation\\xa0of\\xa0polar\\xa0solvents\\xa0and\\xa0the\\xa0conductive \\xa0migration \\xa0of\\xa0dissolved \\xa0ions\\xa0\\n[41,42].\\xa0This\\xa0wields\\xa0pressure \\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0cell\\xa0wall,\\xa0resulting \\xa0in\\xa0cell\\xa0wall\\xa0breakage \\xa0and\\xa0the\\xa0release\\xa0\\nof\\xa0intracellular \\xa0components. \\xa0Another\\xa0approach \\xa0is\\xa0ultrasound ‐assisted\\xa0extraction \\xa0(UAE),\\xa0\\nwhich\\xa0is\\xa0based\\xa0on\\xa0cavitation \\xa0generation \\xa0via\\xa0ultrasound \\xa0waves.\\xa0Turbulence \\xa0and\\xa0interpar‐\\nticle\\xa0collisions \\xa0convert\\xa0sound\\xa0waves\\xa0into\\xa0mechanical \\xa0energy,\\xa0which\\xa0disrupts\\xa0the\\xa0cell\\xa0wall.\\xa0\\nFernandez \\xa0et\\xa0al.\\xa0(2016)\\xa0reported \\xa0the\\xa0use\\xa0of\\xa0UAE\\xa0to\\xa0extract\\xa0fucoidan \\xa0from\\xa0S.\\xa0muticum\\xa0[43].\\xa0\\nFucoidan \\xa0from\\xa0F.\\xa0evanescens \\xa0was\\xa0extracted \\xa0using\\xa0the\\xa0method\\xa0described \\xa0by\\xa0Hmelkov \\xa0et\\xa0al.\\xa0\\n(2017)\\xa0[44].\\xa0Similar\\xa0to\\xa0MAE,\\xa0the\\xa0application \\xa0of\\xa0energy\\xa0should\\xa0be\\xa0optimized \\xa0to\\xa0avoid\\xa0any\\xa0\\npossible\\xa0structural \\xa0alterations. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFigure\\xa02.\\xa0Effect\\xa0of\\xa0solvents\\xa0on\\xa0extraction/purification \\xa0of\\xa0FCSPs.\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0efficient\\xa0extraction \\xa0of\\xa0seaweed \\xa0polysaccharides \\xa0is\\xa0hindered \\xa0by\\xa0the\\xa0complexity \\xa0\\nand\\xa0rigidity\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0cell\\xa0wall.\\xa0This\\xa0has\\xa0led\\xa0to\\xa0the\\xa0use\\xa0of\\xa0carbohydrates \\xa0to\\xa0degrade\\xa0the\\xa0cell\\xa0\\nwall,\\xa0thus\\xa0releasing \\xa0polysaccharides \\xa0and\\xa0other\\xa0bioactive \\xa0components. \\xa0Each\\xa0carbohydrase \\xa0\\nmust\\xa0be\\xa0implemented \\xa0at\\xa0its\\xa0optimal\\xa0pH\\xa0and\\xa0temperature \\xa0to\\xa0obtain\\xa0higher\\xa0yields\\xa0with\\xa0\\npromising \\xa0bioactive \\xa0properties \\xa0[45].\\xa0Sanjeewa \\xa0et\\xa0al.\\xa0(2017)\\xa0isolated\\xa0sulfated\\xa0polysaccha ‐', metadata={'authors': 'Thilina U.

DES are typically made up of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), which can be derived from natural and renewable sources. \n\nDES are considered green solvents due to their low toxicity, low volatility, biodegradability, and potential for recycling. They have been studied extensively as alternatives to conventional organic solvents in various applications, including extraction, catalysis, electrochemistry, and biomass processing.\n\nOne of the key advantages of DES is their ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds, including both polar and non-polar substances. This makes them versatile solvents for a variety of applications in different industries. DES can also be tailored by adjusting the composition of the components to optimize their properties for specific applications.\n\nOverall, DES offer a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional solvents, and their unique properties make them valuable tools for researchers and industry professionals in a range of fields.",

MAAs act as a natural sunscreen, protecting these organisms from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by absorbing UV light and dissipating it as harmless heat. This ability to protect against UV radiation is particularly important for algae and coral living in shallow waters, where UV intensity is high.\n\nMAAs are UV-absorbing compounds that have a unique chemical structure containing a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring with an amino acid side chain. They are biosynthesized via the shikimic acid pathway and are known to have antioxidant properties, which can help protect cells from oxidative stress caused by UV exposure.\n\nIn addition to their role in UV protection, MAAs have also been studied for their potential health benefits for humans. Some research suggests that MAAs may have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and photo-protective effects when consumed, which could be beneficial for skin health and protection against UV-induced damage.\n\nOverall, mycosporine-like amino acids are fascinating compounds with important biological roles in nature, particularly in protecting algae and other marine organisms from the harmful effects of UV radiation.

SC1 hasone water extraction step and one ethanol extraction step, andyields crude fucoidan preparation (CFP). In contrast, the SC2has one water extraction step and three ethanol extraction\\nsteps, and yields puriﬁed fucoidan preparation (PFP). Generally,\\nSC1 is simple, fast, and reactant-saving as compared to SC2.This is the ﬁrst report to compare the antioxidant activity andinhibition of growth of human colon cancer cells of crude andpuriﬁed fucoidan preparations from S. cristaefolium .T h i ss t u d y\\nmight be useful in the selection of a method for isolation ofbioactive fucoidan from brown algae for industrial application.\\n2.

Among the 27 genera of macroalgae and microalgae recorded as having been eaten by the questionnaire participants, the most popu-lar were red seaweeds (60% of phycologists and 71% of the general public). Pyropia spp. were the most commonly pre-ferred. Interestingly, “lack of availability” was the main rea-son for not eating algae. It was concluded that greater information on algae and their wider availability could encourage people to include them as part of a balanced and healthy diet. It is also important to change peoples’ mindset to consider seaweeds not as weeds or wracks but rather as a very versatile and tasty kind of food source (Mouritsen 2017).\\nThe problem for people who do not consume algae on a \\nhistorical basis is often the lack of enzymes required to thor -\\noughly digest dietary seaweeds. The digestive flora of a par -\\nticular person may take up to 4\\xa0 months to produce the dedicated enzymes. Therefore, it is beneficial to eat a small amount of seaweed daily rather than larger amounts occa-sionally (Dhargalkar 2014). However, the popularization of the East Asian diet worldwide has gradually increased public interest and acceptance of seaweed as a food source, partly due to their suggested health benefits. Consequently, con-sumption of seaweed and seaweed-based products is rising, similar to the trend observed with fresh fruits and vegetables (Sharifuddin et\\xa0al. 2015). In European countries, it is pro-posed that seaweeds be indirectly introduced into the human food chain through their addition to the diet of marine ani-mals (e.g. fish, shrimp) produced by aquaculture (Fleurence et\\xa0al. 2012). However, algae are also supplemented directly \\ninto the human diet in different forms: whole seaweed meal (fresh, dried\\xa0– including a dry-ground meal) and processed seaweed (seaweed extracts, bioactive seaweed compounds, homogenates, fermented seaweeds).\\nNowadays, due to continuous exposure to radiation, metal \\npoisoning, gaseous emission, radioactive substances and other pollutions, it is recommended that seaweeds be used on a daily basis, so as to supplement the diet with nutrients and biologically active compounds, detoxify the body and reduce the negative effect of environmental pollution on human health (Dhargalkar 2014). Seaweed products are also used as a substitute for the addition of salt, artificial colours and fla-vours (Pedersen et\\xa0al. 2013). According to data presented by Edwards et\\xa0 al. (2012), the main reasons given for eating algae by phycologists (N\\xa0 =\\xa0 273) and the general public (N\\xa0=\\xa0104) are health 36% vs. 13%, tradition 18% vs. 15% and taste 44% vs. 57%.\\nI.

(2008) showed that meat prod-ucts formulated with the brown seaweeds (Himanthalia elongata, Undaria pinnatifida) had different characteristics \\n(water- and fat-binding properties, hardness, chewiness of the cooked products, lower springiness and cohesiveness, colour changes) from the products made with the red sea-weeds (Pyropia umbilicalis). Better properties were obtained in the case of brown algae, especially Undaria pinnatifida (Cofrades et\\xa0al. 2008).\\nSeaweeds are not a traditional food in the Western diet, \\ndespite occasional use as a conventional ingredient, espe-cially in coastal areas (Bouga and Combet 2015). For exam-\\nple, Fucus spiralis, Pyropia sp. and Osmundea pinnatifida \\nare consumed as food on some of the Azorean Islands, Portugal (Paiva et\\xa0al. 2014); Saccharina digitata, Saccharina \\nlatissima, Undaria pinnatifida, Himanthalia elongata, Ulva \\nsp., Gracilaria verrucosa, Palmaria palmata and Chondrus \\ncrispus in France (MacArtain et\\xa0al. 2007); and Palmaria pal-mata, Saccharina latissima, Saccharina digitata and Alaria \\nesculenta in Norway (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015; Mouritsen et\\xa0al. 2012). France was the first European country where sea-weeds were approved for human consumption (as vegetables and condiments), which opened new opportunities for the food industry. Among them, brown seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Himanthalia \\nelongata and Undaria pinnatifida; red seaweeds, Pyropia \\numbilicalis, Palmaria palmata, Chondrus crispus and \\nGracilaria verrucosa; and green seaweed, Ulva spp. (Mabeau \\nand Fleurence 1993) can be distinguished. With the recent trend towards the increasing popularity of Asian dishes (e.g. sushi) across Europe, seaweeds are being further introduced (Chapman et\\xa0al. 2015). In other parts of the world, including all of the countries in tropical Latin America and most of Africa, seaweeds are an unappreciated resource that can be used for food production (FAO 2016). There are some records of the use of algae as an important ingredient in the diet of early humans in South America. In southern Chile, macroalgae have been used by the native people in food preparations like soups, stews and salads, for example, Macrocystis pyrifera, known as “huiro”, which is eaten sepa-rately; Pyropia columbina, known as “luche”, which is used \\nin soups; and Durvillaea antarctica, known as “cochayuyo”, which is eaten as a salad and in stews together with meat (Astorga-España et\\xa0al. 2017). The use of Latin American sea-weeds as an economic resource can be crucial for the wealth and sustainable livelihoods of coastal communities (Rebours et\\xa0al. 2014).\\nVery interesting research was performed by Edwards \\net\\xa0al. (2012), who fashioned a short questionnaire during the fourth ISAP (International Society for Applied Phycology) conference in Halifax (2011) to gather some information on the algal eating habits of the participants. It was found that 93% of the conference members (mainly phycologists, N\\xa0=\\xa0273, 35 nationalities) had previously eaten algae, as well as 64% of the general public (N\\xa0=\\xa0104, 25 nationalities).

Several complex responses are performed, depending on the directions of temperature changes, duration and rate. During heat stress, plants may induce evaporative cooling by opening their stomata, reduce the surface area exposed to sun by decreasing leaf turgor and change leaf orientation or even cause them to fall off. Reduced temperatures can result in plant dormancy or excretion of antifreezing compounds into the cytoplasm, so as to lower the freezing temperature of plant fluids (Zinn et\\xa0al. 2010; Walbot 2011; Bita and Gerats \\n2013). Fluctuations in temperature strongly affect plant development and productivity; thus, products alleviating the effect of such changes are strongly desired. Optimal temperatures for the growth of plants strongly depend on the considered species. For each species, a defined range of maximum and minimum temperatures form the boundaries of observable growth. For most plant species, vegetative development usually has a higher optimum temperature than reproductive development (Hatfield and Prueger 2015).\\nArabidopsis thaliana was used as the model plant in the \\ntemperature stress tests evaluating the activity of Ascophyllum nodosum extracts and their lipophilic fractions. Application of extracts significantly increased tolerance to freezing temperatures during in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo assays. Untreated plants exhibited severe chlorosis and tissue damage and failed to recover from freezing treatments, while the extract- treated plants recovered from freezing temperatures of 7.5\\xa0°C in\\xa0vitro and 5.5\\xa0°C in\\xa0vivo assays. What is more, during the recovery stage after the period with decreased temperature, plants treated with seaweed extracts exhibited 70% less chlorophyll damage in comparison with untreated plants. That suggests that Ascophyllum nodosum extracts are able to \\ninduce specific systemic physiological responses in plants (Rayirath et\\xa0al. 2009).\\nTwo cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivars were \\nexposed to low temperature conditions (7\\xa0±\\xa01\\xa0°C) and the effect of the application of seaweed extracts (seaforce and seamino).

The thiolated polymer (thiomer) forms disulfide bonds within its polymeric network and with cysteine-rich subdomains of the mucus layer. Thiolated alginates are  used as in situ gelling hydrogels, and are under preliminary research as possible mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.

Warm Water Extraction Procedure\\nThe compressional-puffed algal sample was mixed with 95% ethanol ( w/v= 1:10), shaken for\\n4 h at room temperature to remove pigments, proteins and lipid, and then centrifuged at 970 ×g\\nfor 10 min. The residue was collected, mixed with double-distilled water ( w/v= 1:10) and placed\\nin a water-bath kept at 40◦C for 15 min with shaking (120 rpm) to extract the polysaccharides.\\nThe mixture was centrifuged at 3870 ×gfor 10 min and the supernatant was collected. Ethanol (95%)\\nwas added into the supernatant to give a ﬁnal ethanol concentration of 20% in order to precipitate\\nalginic acid. The mixture was centrifugated at 9170 ×gfor 30 min, the supernatant was collected,\\nand 95% ethanol was added until a ﬁnal ethanol concentration of 50% was reached in order to obtain\\nfucoidan precipitate. The ethanol-precipitated fucoidan was then recovered by centrifugation at 9170 ×\\ngfor 30 min, dried at 40◦C, milled, and stored for further analyses. Extraction yield was calculated\\nusing the following equation:\\nExtraction yield (%) = ( gA/gB)×100 (1)\\nwhere gArepresents the weight of the extracted solid on a dry basis, and gBis the weight of the sample\\non a dry basis.\\n3.4. Analytical Methods\\nThe determinations of crude protein, fat, moisture, and ash were carried out using the following\\nAOAC procedures. Protein, fat, and ash were calculated on a dry basis. Carbohydrate was calculated\\nas weight differences between the total weight and the sum of the amounts of moisture, protein,\\nlipid, and ash. The phenol-sulfuric acid colorimetric method was utilized to determine the total sugar\\ncontent, and L-fucose was used as the standard. The fucose content was determined according to the\\nmethod of Gibbons [ 43] using L-fucose as the standard. Uronic acids were estimated by the colorimetric\\nmethod using D-galacturonic acid as the standard [ 44]. Protein in the extract was quantiﬁed by the\\nBradford method using BSA as the standard. Polyphenols were analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu\\nmethod and gallic acid was utilized as a standard agent. Alginate content was measured according\\nto the previously described method [ 45]. For the determination of sulfate content, the sample was\\nhydrolyzed with 1 N HCl solution for 5 h at 105◦C. The hydrolysate was then quantiﬁed based on the\\npercentage of sulfate composition using Dionex ICS-1500 Ion Chromatography (Sunnyvale, CA, USA)\\nwith an IonPac AS9-HC column (4 ×250 mm) at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min at 30◦C with conductometric\\ndetection. A solution of 9 mM Na 2CO 3was used as the eluent, and K 2SO4was used as the standard.\\n3.5. Color Analysis\\nThe algal samples (about 15 g) with different pufﬁng conditions were used for the determination of\\ncolor. Tristimulus color values, namely L(lightness), a(redness-greenness), and b(yellowness-blueness)\\nvalues, were measured using a spectrophotometer (SA-2000, Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.,\\nTokyo, Japan). The data were recorded using at least three separate algal samples for each test point.\\nThe blackness was obtained using the following equation:\\nBlackness =√\\n(100−L)2+a2+b2 (2)\\n3.6. Sensory Evaluation\\nSensory evaluation was conducted using a 30-member panel. Algal samples (about 30 g) from\\ndifferent pufﬁng conditions were placed in test tubes with screw caps. Panelists were instructed to\\nremove the screw caps, smell the contents, and identify the odor that they perceived, as well as indicate\\ntheir degree of liking of the odor. The degree of liking was based on a seven-point hedonic scale\\n(1 = dislike extremely; 4 = neither like nor dislike; 7 = like extremely).', metadata={'authors': 'Wen-Ning Yang, Po-Wei Chen, Chun-Yung Huang  ', 'file_name': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC5484133.pdf', 'page': 12.0, 'publication_date': '2017', 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/PMC5484133.pdf', 'title': 'Compositional Characteristics and In Vitro Evaluations of Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Properties of Crude Extracts of Fucoidan Prepared from Compressional Puffing-Pretreated Sargassum crassifolium  '}), Document(page_content='Mar.

Theoretically, 1 kg of\\nglucose and xylose produce 0.51 kg ethanol with 0.49 kg of CO\\n2[82,93,99].\\nOne of the main complications of effective fermentation is the incapability of\\ncommonly used microorganisms that convert pentose sugars into bioethanol. There-fore, economic bioethanol production must use all potential feedstocks (i.e., cellu-lose and hemicellulose). Naturally occurring microorganisms that convert primarypentose sugar from hemicellulose like xylose into bioethanol exist, for example,\\nspeciﬁc bacteria, fungi, and yeasts [ 74]. Fermentation processes are represented by\\nthe following strategies [ 74,93,100]:\\n1. Separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF)\\n2. Simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation (SSF)\\n3. Simultaneous sacchari ﬁcation and co-fermentation (SSCF)\\n4. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP)\\nSSF and SHF are primarily used to produce bioethanol from microalgae using\\ndifferent fermentation strategies with various fermentative microorganisms\\n(Table 12.5). The total valuation of the fermentation process is usually based on\\ncell growth, consumption of reducing sugar, and bioethanol production. Environ-mental and operational factors greatly in ﬂuence bioethanol production from algal\\nbiomass, like (i) nutrient levels; (ii) alkalinity; (iii) concentration of toxic substances;(iv) temperature; and (v) optimum pH of the fermenting microorganism [ 74].\\n12.5.1 Separated Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF)\\nEnzymatic sacchari ﬁcation of starchy biomass is carried out ﬁrst in a SHF process at\\nthe optimum temperature using a saccharifying enzyme. The sacchari ﬁed solution is\\nthen fermented using suitable microorganisms [ 93]. These advantages of SHF are\\nthe low capital cost of chemicals, short residence time, and simple equipmentsystems, which inspire its large-scale processing [ 93,100]. The SHF process is\\nusually active in research studies to enhance the operative conditions such as pH,temperature, and time of both stages, which help determine the diverse mechanismsinvolved in the process and the effect as displayed by several parameters andcontinuous fermentation with cell recycling. Nevertheless, the operation procedure\\nof SHF has some drawbacks. When compared with SSF (Sect. 12.5.2 below), the\\nSHF process has disadvantages such as higher capital cost due to the large mechan-ical setup for separation steps, and elevated enzyme concentrations and low solidsloading required to achieve good ethanol yields.\\nMoreover, the longtime running of the process may lead to contamination of the\\nsubstrate by microorganisms [ 108].

At night, hydrogen is produced by\\nwater electrolysis using low-cost nighttime electric power with low CO 2emission\\nand stores the hydrogen in metal hydride tanks. During the day, electric power isgenerated by the fuel cell using the stored hydrogen to meet the electric powerdemand of the building. The chilled water and hot water generated in theseprocesses are also utilized. Electric power from renewable energy, such as photo-voltaic and wind power, can also be used for hydrogen production.

At the same time, the revenue is expected to \\nreach over US$ 1.1  · 109 at 7.4% CAGR by 2024 (Transparency \\nMarket Research 2016 ).

The fastest-developing \\nmarket is for agar, as it provides AAGR at a level of 7%. \\nContrarily, AAGR for alginates is negative, while their price is still high\\xa0– US$ 14 per kg, as compared to US$ 9 for car -\\nrageenan and US$17 for agar (Porse and Rudolph 2017 ).\\nThe volume of the phycocolloid market is reflected in its \\nvalue, which reaches US$ 3.8  · 108 (Markets and Markets \\n2015 ), US$ 2.5  · 108 (Grand View Research 2017b ; Mordor \\nIntelligence 2017a ), and US$ 7.6  · 108 (Micromarket Monitor \\n2017 ; Mordor Intelligence 2017b ) for alginates, agar, and \\ncarrageenan, respectively.

This will be good news for the ecologically minded, since the \\n“boom and bust” cycles of seaweed production will be avoided through expanded \\ncultivation development. \\n There has been a very recent shift in research focus, away from techniques for \\nthe production of commodities (e.g., carrageenan), towards functional products \\nwith higher value. This research focus is supporting the development of high value \\nmarkets for functional products. There are a number of nations focused on applied \\nphycological research such as Korea, France and Ireland, but also a great diversity \\nof bioassay studies on local seaweed ﬂ  ora (not just commercially available sea-\\nweeds) which have been undertaken worldwide in an effort to valorize seaweed \\nresources. The number of research efforts within the ﬁ  eld of applied phycology on \\nthe health beneﬁ  ts of seaweeds has accelerated in recent times and this will result in \\nthe development of novel foods from non-traditionally sourced seaweeds (i.e., the \\ndiminutive, non-dominant genera which currently cannot be sourced economically). \\nHistory has shown that within the ﬁ  eld of applied phycology, a combination of mar-\\nket demand and biological research has led to the development and implementation \\nof successful seaweed cultivation. The trend will continue in the future, with the \\ndevelopment of functional product markets. Market demand will be supplied from \\ncultivated seaweeds, and the importance of on-land cultivation will grow. Since it \\nallows for non-traditional seaweeds to be sourced as functional raw materials. The \\nhighest levels of traceability, safety, and consistent efﬁ  cacy is achieved with on-land \\ncultivation, therefore this technique will become more common for the highest \\nvalue markets, including food and functional products. The partnering of developers \\nwith raw material suppliers will become more common as it is in similar industries \\n(e.g., as with nutra/pharmaceutical developers and suppliers), and the development \\nof a science-based functional seaweed industry will begin to ﬂ  ourish. The future of \\nthe advanced seaweed industry lies in the development of high value markets with \\ncultivated, highly traceable, standardized and efﬁ  cacious seaweeds. \\n The domestication and subsequent industrial scale cultivation of seaweeds \\n(begun in the 1950s) is most certainly in its infancy when compared to terrestrial \\nagriculture (thousands of years). As such, the seaweed industry currently relies on a \\nvery limited number of species and cultivars developed for rapid growth or environ-\\nmental compatibility with local conditions. As the industry moves toward value- \\nadded production, away from commodities, there needs to be more intensive focus \\non the development of cultivars that not only resist disease, and grow rapidly but \\nalso contain elevated levels of bioactive compounds of interest. Over reliance on \\nmonoculture of vegetative clones opens the possibility of rapid spread of disease \\nand the study of disease and epiphyte resistance is also an area requiring more \\nfocused effort (Loureiro et al.  2012  ). Genetic improvement can be achieved through \\ntraditional selection and breeding programs and this type of research will become \\nimportant for the improvement of current cultivated production, and for the future \\n(Robinson et al.  2012  ). Genetic modiﬁ  cation of seaweeds, while possible, has the \\npotential to erase the benign public opinion that currently surrounds the cultivation \\nof seaweeds, and should be avoided.

Algae polysaccharides play a fundamental role in various emerging areas of biotechnology, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and different industries. \\nMany algal species are consumed as food by humans and commercially exploited \\nworldwide. Moreover, algae also play a key role as producers in the marine envi-\\nronment (Pradhan et al. \\n2022 ). Speciﬁcally, the great importance of seaweeds for \\nhealth is noted; however, the expansion is still limited due to the high prevalence of \\nrecalcitrant diseases and epiphytic pests, presenting potential for emergence and \\ndissemination, especially due to the absence of effective national and international \\nbiosafety policies. Seaweeds have been increasingly arousing interest as a human \\nfood source due to the valuable nutritional properties reported in their composition, such as abundance of protein, ﬁbre, vitamins, and minerals, with relatively low lipid \\ncontent (Kazir et al. \\n2019 ; Fleurence and Levine 2016 ). Application of algal \\nbioactive compounds is not only limited to food safety and human health, but also \\ninvolves factors such as the costs, product efﬁcacy, and compliance with current \\nlegislation, which are of vital importance in deciding on the viability and commercial \\nproduction of a product. However, there are still some challenges to overcome for \\nthe commercialisation speciﬁcally of bioactive compounds extracted from algae. \\nThis includes the optimisation of extraction and puriﬁcation processes, the develop-\\nment of storage alternatives and the implementation of technologies that improve the \\nbioaccessibility and bioavailability of these compounds. Recently, different encap-\\nsulation or emulsiﬁcation processes have been developed to ensure that bioactive \\ncompounds achieve their biological function in humans. \\nThe lack of global uniformity in legislation between countries makes the process \\neven more complex. Therefore, to enable the marketing of algae-derived products, \\nmodiﬁcations are required to ensure compliance with current legislation. In the \\nEuropean Union, for example, as seaweeds are not traditionally consumed as food before 1997, they are considered as a ‘novel food’ according to EU Regulation 2015/ \\n2283. This is also adopted for products obtained from algae, such as food supple-\\nments containing bioactive components or food additives, such as ﬂorotannins from \\nEcklonia cava. Therefore, for these products to be placed on the market, authorisa-\\ntion is required from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

There have been signiﬁ  cant events such as the \\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis,  Escherichia coli   contamination of \\nspinach and other vegetables, and considerations such as genetically modiﬁ  ed (GM) \\ncrops entering the food chain. Consumers are demanding assurances that ingredi-\\nents and raw materials are safe, and this has focused the food industry on traceabil-\\nity. Traceability relates to the origin of materials, their processing history, and the \\ndistribution chain of consumer products. A requirement of industrial food produc-\\ntion and distribution is the ability to trace a product’s history by means of recorded \\ndata (Bertolini et al.  2006  ). \\n The European Union (EU) has some of the most stringent requirements for trace-\\nability. The development of GM foods and the safety concerns of many consumers \\naround these products, led to the requirement that all GM foods be labeled as such \\nin the EU. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), deﬁ  nes “traceability” as \\nthe ability to trace or follow a food, feed, food-producing animal or substance \\nintended to be, or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed, through all stages \\nof production, processing and distribution. France was the ﬁ  rst European country \\n(1990) to establish speciﬁ  c regulations concerning the use of seaweeds for human \\nconsumption (Mabeau and Fleurence  1993  ). Under these regulations, seaweeds \\nmust meet certain consumer safety regulations for maximum allowed levels of toxic \\nminerals (lead, cadmium, tin, mercury, mineral arsenic and iodine), as well as maxi-\\nmum allowed bacterial loads. Within Europe, some countries are not subject to any \\nparticular regulations (Ireland, Denmark, The Netherlands), while in others they \\nhave not been considered food, and have been strictly forbidden (Greece).

DES are analogues of ionic liquids formed by hydro-\\ngen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor in a ﬁxed molar ratio (Tao et al. 2010 ). \\nIt was identiﬁed as advantageous over other catalysts possessing higher chemical \\nstability, non-corrosiveness, and are less toxic to the environment (Haider et al. \\n2021 ). The formed DES have lower melting point than the hydrogen donor and \\nacceptor. This low melting point is because of stronger interaction between the donor \\nand acceptor of the hydrogen bond (Sharma et al. 2022 ). The other forces such as \\nelectrostatic, van der Waals interactions, and lattice energy are also found to be \\ninﬂuencing the DES formation (Smith et al. 2014 ). Based on the hydrogen bond \\ndonor and acceptor, DES can be categorized into ﬁve types. Type 1 DES are formed \\nfrom quaternary ammonium salts and metal chlorides, type 2 DES are made of \\nquaternary ammonium salts and metal chloride hydrates, type 3 contains DES made of choline chloride and alcohols, type 4 DES are composed of metal chloride with hydrogen bond donor, and type 5 DES are made of non-ionic molecular hydrogen \\nbond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor (Ijardar et al. \\n2022 ). Hydrogen bond \\nformation confers a lower melting point to DES which can also be modiﬁed based \\non the desired requirements through selecting hydrogen donor and acceptor \\n(Maheshwari et al. 2021 ). DES were identiﬁed as efﬁcient catalyst and green solvent \\nfor extracting FAME (Table 4). The table displays the signiﬁcant transesteriﬁcation \\nyield using DES as catalyst and the maximum is 97%, which is on par with the yield obtained by conventional alkali catalysts. Moreover, DES can also be applied widely \\nto isolate pigments and phenolic products. In such a case, DES could potentially \\nexhibit multifunction (Fig. \\n4) in algal biotechnology as in transesteriﬁcation and \\npigment extraction which could be ideally suitable for integrated algal bioreﬁnery. \\nMoreover, DES as a cosolvent can improve the catalytic activity of chemical \\ncatalyst by reducing the side reactions and eventually facilitate easy separation of the biocatalyst (Škulcová et al. \\n2016 ). For example, DES are proven to reduce the side \\nreactions like saponiﬁcation and also aid in the separation of catalyst from the \\nreaction system. DES are advantageous as transesteriﬁcation catalysts because they are insensitive to water, not requiring extreme experimental conditions, are simple preparations, and have less toxicity (Soltanmohammadi et al. \\n2021 ). Several \\nstudies reported the transesteriﬁcation of palm oil using DES, which revealed about 70% and a maximum of 97% of conversions achieved (Mohebbi et al. \\n2020 ). DES \\ncan also be easily separated from the reaction system as once the reaction completes, the desired product will be present in the distinct layer, whereas DES mixture will be in the lower phase (Hayyan et al. \\n2013 ). The catalytic activity of DES is not \\nconsiderably reduced even after 4 runs of transesteriﬁcation as the conversion just reduced to 87% (fourth cycle) from 93% (ﬁrst cycle), which supports the economy of the process (Hayyan et al. \\n2013 ).
